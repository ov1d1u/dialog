The continuous crackling of the wireless; the distant voices speaking in languages he did not understand. The colourful spines of enormous books.

He lay in bed and listened to the insistent mewing of the cat which sat watching him from the top of the cupboard; and he listened, above all, to the distant, hypnotic washing of the waves on the rocks that lulled him to sleep. He understood why he was here. He understood, too, that he was one of the lucky ones. He had been taken away to start a better life here. But at this point in time he did not feel lucky, nor did he really know what a better life would entail. As he drifted off to sleep he wondered if he missed the orphanage, and wondered if it was this that made him sad. But he experienced no nostalgia or longing; instead he found that his recollections of the orphanage were already thick and hazy, opaque in his mind’s eye. Lying in bed listening to the constant wash of the waves he began to realise that the sadness he felt would not last forever; it was a different kind of sadness from anything he might have experienced previously. Somehow, he knew that in this new house, with this frightened, frightening man, he could overcome these sensations of sorrow. He had much to fear in this new life, but fear was no longer something huge and undefined and terrifying. It was something he could master. He knew that now. And so he would fall asleep.

The fair-haired children in these pictures wore nice thick clothes and looked strong-boned and happy, unlike the children Adam had known, who had not been very happy. They had been skinny, like Adam himself, and constantly tired, and some of the smaller ones had distended stomachs even though they had nothing to eat. Maybe it was easy to be happy if you had nice clothes and food and parents, Adam thought; maybe it would be easy for him to be happy from now on. He liked these pictures because they made him feel that he was like these children and not like the ones in the orphanage. These healthy European children looked like immature versions of Karl, and as Adam watched Karl working in the yard outside, he could imagine Karl skating on frozen ponds or walking in pine forests; and Adam realised that Karl, too, was a long way from home. Adam also found books with pictures of pictures – paintings of women who looked almost like local women, but not quite: they were fleshier and their eyes were brighter, not tinged with jaundice or cataracts. They wore flowers behind their ears and looked straight at Adam, as if questioning him: Where was he from? Was he one of them, or something else? He did not like these pictures so much." />

As Karl read these stories Adam would gaze out at the retreating tide; the waves were always flat at this hour, barely a ripple, and pools of calm water would begin to form in the recesses of the reef. He liked the stories – he can remember each one to this day – but most of all he wished that Karl would read him stories about those fair-skinned children who were full of laughter. In their world people were not turned into statues or animals, and night demons were not called upon to take sides in ancient feuds. It was safer over there, he thought.

They had heard of Karl and his house when they arrived on the island and knew they would find a safe place to stay for a few nights while they arranged their passage back to Jakarta and beyond. They arrived with a single suitcase, looking sunburnt and dusty. Karl welcomed them courteously and surrendered his own room to them, but for two whole days there was a strained silence, for the man spoke little Indonesian (he had learnt only the unhelpful dialect of the Ngada of Flores) and his wife could speak none at all, save a few words of instruction to the cook before mealtimes. When they spoke Dutch it thrilled Adam to hear the sound of the rich, rasping words, but Karl responded briskly in English or else ignored them altogether. So that’s what it sounds like, Adam thought, and all of a sudden the individual words and short phrases he had learnt from looking at the Dutch books on the shelves began to make sense. He was upset by Karl’s refusal to speak Dutch and by his refusal to be more hospitable. Adam did not understand why Karl could not be friends with these people, for they were just like Karl. In those days he did not yet understand that Home was not necessarily where you were born, or even where you grew up, but something else entirely, something fragile that could exist anywhere in the world. Back then Adam was merely angry with Karl because he did not understand this, and many other things." />

A pile of thin cotton shirts lay next to her, and Adam watched as she picked them up one by one and folded them carefully before rearranging them into the case. They were tiny, made for an infant, and decorated with pale pink-and-red flowers. She began to speak, very softly, in Dutch, even though Adam couldn’t respond. As she spoke Adam thought of those healthy blond children in the picture books; somehow he knew that she was speaking of children. When she finished she touched his cheek very lightly and stroked his hair. She said something and shook her head; her smile was weak. ‘No understand?’ she said in Indonesian. She was right, Adam could not understand. He said, ‘Onthaal aan mijn huis.’ He had seen the words in a book and thought that he knew roughly what it meant. She broke into a deep, warm laugh. ‘Thank you, Adam de Willigen,’ she said, wiping her eyes. ‘Thank you’." />

Even with the louvred windows open, the room was hot and still; the ceiling fan raised just enough wind to ruffle the pages of the newspaper. The headline read, ‘STUDENTS REVOLTING IN CLASSROOMS.’ ‘They’re always revolting,’ she added. She had hardly bothered to read the paper. It was too hot and the news was always the same. Din put a can of Coke on her desk. ‘I didn’t know there were still any students in the classrooms.’ He picked up the newspaper and sat at his desk. ‘Have you read this? There was a fire in the Science block on Thursday. Arson, they think. Did you see anything? I didn’t, and I was here all day. Look, they caught the culprit – he looks like one of your students, though it’s difficult to tell. These mug shots all look the same to me. They’re always nice clean-looking boys from the provinces with glossy hair and pressed shirts.’ ‘Either that or they’re dead and lying face down in a pool of their own blood surrounded by policemen, in which case they could be anyone. The police can kill anyone nowadays and we just say, “Hey, there’s a dead body,” without really knowing, or caring, who it was. It could have been one of mine. I’m surprised I haven’t lost any yet. One of them told me the other day that they were making Molotov cocktails in the labs, for chrissake. And you know what really got to me? Not that they were making bombs on campus, but that they thought I wouldn’t care, that I would sympathise. What on earth are we doing in this place? It’s just too depressing for words.’" />

True, she did not often feel like this, but just sometimes she would feel weighed down by a profound lassitude, something that seized her and drained her of all energy and hope and desire. This usually happened in those dead hours between coming home and going out again for the evening, and on the few times she felt it coming on she thought, ‘Uh-oh, I have to do something about this.’ And lately these dips in morale were accompanied by a funny tightening of the chest that made it difficult to breathe – just for a few minutes, but long enough for her to have to sit down and catch her breath. Maybe it was the humidity, maybe she was turning into yet another pudgy old white woman who couldn’t take the heat; maybe it was age, god forbid. But eventually she would haul herself to the shower, and, feeling better, she would step out into the still-warm evening. No: what she felt now was not depression but something akin to boredom, though she was not bored either. She didn’t really know how she felt." />

You at least have a choice.’ ‘You mean, admit defeat? You know me better than that.’ ‘I don’t really know you very well at all. And I’m serious: why don’t you leave?’ Din didn’t look up from the newspaper but continued to hold it up before him so that it shielded his face. The back page bore a picture of a badminton player, his thick black hair slicked back in imitation of American movie stars, his smile reflected on the swell of a polished trophy. The headline trumpeted: PRAISE GOD FOR THE THOMAS CUP. Margaret could not tell from his placid, monotonous voice what he truly meant. Only by watching for small signs like the faint narrowing at the very edges of his eyes (pleasure) or the slight indentation of his dimples (sarcasm or contempt) could she read what he meant. ‘For the same reason as you,’ she said. ‘The job here’s not finished. I can’t just abandon these kids.’ ‘So you do sympathise with them.’ ‘If that’s your way of asking if I’m a communist, you know what my answer is.’ ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t intend any offence, and you know that I don’t care about politics. I’m just interested to know why you stay here instead of going home.’ ‘The States? Boy, you know how to annoy me. I was conceived on one continent, born on another and raised on four – five if you count Australia. I lived in America for less than ten years, not even twenty-five per cent of my life. Would you call that home? Why don’t you go home? I’ve heard Medan isn’t so bad. Or you could go to Holland – again. They educated you, after all.’ Din lowered his newspaper and Margaret studied his face for clues. There was nothing for a while, and then a completely blank, unreadable smile. It was something she’d begun to notice only recently and it made her feel uncomfortable. Her ability to discern moods in other people was something else she was proud of. She had been doing it – and doing it well – ever since she could remember, before she could talk, even. She thought of the opening line of her (unfinished) doctoral thesis ‘Tchambuli: Kinship and Understanding in Northern Papua New Guinea’, which lay in a locked drawer just below her left knee. That line read, ‘It is the nonverbal communication between human beings that forms the basis of all society.’ She had always believed that people (well, she) could read things that remained unsaid, just like tribes in the jungle who had little need for sophisticated language. She had never before come across someone like Din. Sometimes she found him completely Western, other times utterly Indonesian, sometimes primitive. She thought again of her thesis, locked away together with her passport at the foot of her desk. She had not looked at either in such a long time. ‘I have no family left in Sumatra and my Dutch was never very good,’ he said at last. Margaret stood up and made a cursory attempt to tidy her desk. ‘Hey, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. I don’t know why I’m so crabby these days. It’s just so frustrating.’ ‘What is?’ Margaret lifted her arms to gesture out of the windows, but then just shrugged, sighing. ‘Everything. You know what I mean.’ Din nodded. ‘I think I do.’" />

Everything looked grey to her now in Jakarta. The new squat concrete shops, the flimsy wooden shanties, the six-lane highways, the dead water in the canals, the banners that were strung up everywhere across the city, whose whiteness dulled quickly from the dust and smoke and the exhaust fumes that choked the air. She did not know when she’d stopped noticing the colours and the details of Jakarta, or when this greyness had begun to form like cataracts that clouded her appreciation of the city. On the building across the concrete square hung painted banners that urged NO IMPERIALISM CRUSH MALAYSIA or FRIENDSHIP TO AFRICA or EVER ONWARD NO RETREAT IN THE NAME OF ALLAH. She felt a sudden surge of irritation: Why was it that everything in this city was written in capitals? Whenever she went to dinner at the Hotel Java the entire menu was in bold upper case, every item screaming its existence at her, insisting that she choose it and not something else, every dish jostling with its neighbour in a cacophony of advertisement. NORTH SUMATRAN FAVOURITE FROM BANDUNG EVER POPULAR DISH OF TORAJA KINGS. As if this assault were not enough, the prices too were announced in oversized numbers, though it wasn’t clear to Margaret if this was an advertisement of how low they were or yet another mild form of extortion, the like of which Margaret experienced every day. Maybe she could no longer deal with the noise and the crowds and the bullying and the corruption, and had, therefore, stopped wanting to see the city in detail; maybe this was why she had begun to see everything in terms of greyness. She mulled over the possibility of this sometimes when she picked unenthusiastically at a TYPICAL EAST JAVA DELICACY in the lavish black marble surroundings of the Hotel Java. Was Margaret Bates becoming soft? In the end she decided that it was the city that had changed. Margaret Bates had not softened with age. And that was the problem, she knew that. Adaptation is the key to human existence, she used to tell her students. The Ability to Adapt: that was another of her strengths, along with her Resistance to Emotional Instability and her Reading of Moods. Yet here she was, frozen in time, waiting for the city to change back into something she recognised. It would not happen. She had known a different country, a gentler country, she thought. She hated that word, ‘gentler’ – it was maudlin and sentimental; it reminded her of the way old white fools would talk about their plantations and their brown servants. Suddenly she hated herself." />

I cannot go on like this. I must change, I must change. ‘What did you say?’ Din asked, folding his newspaper at last. ‘Nothing,’ Margaret said, turning round. She looked at Din’s clear, slightly watery eyes and felt guilty at having snapped at him earlier. She wished that she was able to think things through before saying them. ‘Let’s get an early dinner. Then we can go to the Hotel Java or somewhere fancy, you know, have some drinks – something strong and colourful with a little umbrella in it. We can watch all those ridiculous rich people with their prostitutes.’ Din pulled his chair closer to his desk and flipped open a notebook. ‘It’s too early for dinner,’ he said, picking up a pen and removing its cap. He held the pen poised over the notepad but he did not write anything. ‘Besides, they won’t let me into the Hotel Java. Not like this, anyway.’ He held the collar of his shirt between his thumb and forefinger for a second before letting it fall. ‘I’m not taking no for an answer,’ Margaret said. She grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the door. ‘You’re with me, no one will say anything. It’s one of those disgusting privileges of being white in a place like this. Everyone says they hate Westerners, but as soon as an orang putih walks into the room they give them whatever they want. Every other blanquito I know breaks the rules and behaves badly, and tonight I intend to partake of this disgusting orgy.’ They crossed the highway on the overhead walkway. Beneath them the never-ending traffic beeped and hooted and revved as usual, a river of bashed-up, rusting steel whose current flowed everywhere and nowhere. The sun had begun to calm slightly, hazy now behind the perpetual layer of cloud; the sky was a dirty yellow, a yellow overlaid with grey, and soon, when the sun was setting, it would turn mouse-coloured and finally – swiftly – black. There was never any blue, nothing true or clear." />

He rode with surprising speed and agility, passing men and women pushing their cartloads of peanuts and scrap newspaper and fruit. Stallholders along the road cried out to them as the rickshaw went past; they offered watches, toys, magazines, bottles of Benzine. Often Margaret thought they would collide with something – a horse-drawn cart or a bare-framed jeep or a bicycle – but at the last moment their driver would casually veer past the obstacle. Every few minutes they went past an accident or a broken-down vehicle. There were few cars, few recognisable ones, anyway. Everything had been cannibalised, picked to pieces and reassembled to look like something else so that it was impossible to identify a car as a Datsun or a Fiat or a Skoda. Something could begin as a Mercedes, morph mid-chassis into a Cadillac and end up an open-sided lorry. She looked across at Din, whose serious expression never seemed to alter very much. A more or less permanent frown drew his close-set, almond-shaped eyes even closer together and lent his slim features an air of mild anxiety." />

He was certainly a great improvement over the last few who had filled his position; they had been, by and large, American post-graduate students earnestly pursuing dull projects on the Economics of Oil or International Aid in Newly-Independent Asia. Without exception, they had been spectacularly unsuited to life in South-East Asia. The longest-serving of them had stayed for two years, the shortest a mere three months. There were rumours that they might not have been bona fide students, that they were in fact working for the US Government, but Margaret could not substantiate these rumours. She did find it slightly odd that there was such a steady stream of American students wanting to be teaching assistants in Jakarta, but there was nothing to suggest that they were funded by anything more sinister than indulgent Ivy League scholarships. Once or twice, she had casually slipped into conversation the presence of the CIA in Indonesia, which was an open secret in town, but she was met by blinking incomprehension, so she let the matter rest. In this city you could never be sure if anyone was who they said they were and, frankly, Margaret couldn’t care less. Din, however, seemed far removed from the sordid details of Jakarta life. He did not have a comfortable scholarship to fall back on, and Margaret felt guilty because there was no money to pay him properly. In fact neither of them had drawn any salary for this month and although he never complained she knew that even his small rented room would soon begin to weigh heavily on his finances. He said he had taken a room in Kebayoran, but she did not believe him; it would be far too expensive for him. She knew that he did not want her to think him destitute, just another semi slum-dweller. He wanted her to believe that he was an ordinary middle-class professional, and she was happy to go along with it. But she did not know how long he could continue like this.

Margaret wondered if he suffered from that respect of hierarchy that (she had noticed) seems to plague all Asians, so that she, being his elder and superior, could never be a companion with whom he could converse freely. It troubled her somewhat to think of herself as a Mother Superior figure, wizened and stern. ‘I can understand that,’ she said, deciding not to push too far. She wished he would relax in her company, and she began to imagine how the evening might proceed if she had her way. They would have something simple to eat at a street stall and then they would have drinks, lots of them, and at some point in the evening he would begin to confide in her, telling her all about his village sweetheart and the girls he had had in Holland; he would begin to trust her, think of her as his equal, his confidante, and the next morning, at work, they would be friends and colleagues and she would no longer feel awkward in his company." />

The air was filled with the steady hum of portable generators and strings of naked bulbs burst sharply into life, casting their harsh glare on to the faces of passers-by. There were not many people there yet, and Margaret and Din were able to stroll around for a few minutes before settling on a place to eat. ‘What do you feel like eating?’ Margaret asked. ‘Anything. It’s up to you.’ She’d known he would say that and had therefore already decided. ‘Why don’t we just grab some Nasi Padang? Since you’re Sumatran. It’ll make you think of home.’ They chose a place at random, sitting down at a fold-up table that wobbled when Margaret put her elbows on it. Din sat facing her, though he did not look at her face but stared into the space beyond her left shoulder. He looked clean and neat, as he always did, his plain white short-sleeved shirt uncreased even at the end of the day. He never seemed to perspire. This evening he was not wearing the thick black-rimmed glasses that he wore at work, and Margaret was glad because she had a clearer view of his eyes. ‘Isn’t this nice?’ she said. ‘The first time we have been out together.’ Even as she said so she was aware of the inappropriateness of it: she, a white woman, he a young Javanese man, together in public. They didn’t like this kind of behaviour, the Indonesians, she knew that. Perhaps this was why he was being so stiff. She looked around quickly but could see no other foreigners. A young woman came and took their order; she looked sexless in her baggy male clothing – oversized shirt, buttoned at the collar, and dirty pleated trousers – and disapproving. Margaret felt her own décolletage, modest though it was, suddenly too revealing. ‘Tell me about the research you started in Holland,’ Margaret said once they had ordered. They were on surer ground if they stuck to work matters; he liked talking about his work. ‘Pre-Islamic religion, wasn’t it?’ ‘More or less,’ he said, his gaze shifting gently but noticeably so that he met her eye and held it. It caught her off-guard, this sudden switching of moods, and she blinked and smiled to hide her unease. She didn’t like being taken aback this way. ‘Actually it was a bit wider than that,’ he continued. ‘I was looking into writing a Secret History of the Indonesian Islands in the South East, everything from Bali eastwards. To me those islands were like a lost world where everything remained true and authentic, away from the gaze of foreigners – a kind of invisible world, almost. Such a stupid idea.’ ‘Why stupid?’ ‘Oh.’ He smiled, suddenly bashful again. ‘Such a big subject – too big for a little guy like me.’ ‘I think it’s a wonderful idea. You shouldn’t give up.’ ‘No, there’s no hope for someone like me. I was stupid to think I could do something like that, as if I were a Westerner.’ He spoke with no bitterness, but a despair so deep that it felt almost calm. He won’t be shaken from it, thought Margaret; it was so frustrating. ‘What a thing to say,’ she said, trying not to sound didactic. ‘You can do anything you put your mind to. I’m not saying it’s easy, but if you want something, you’ll get it. Don’t be so defeatist.’ The food arrived, dishes of watery curries of meat and vegetables. Margaret peered at the rice and noticed that it had been mixed with maize. ‘I think we have a civic-conscious vendor on our hands,’ she said. Since the previous year’s drought every meal was a lottery. Sometimes your rice would be rice, other times it would be a gritty bowl of ground meal, in accordance with government recommendations. ‘Maybe you’re right,’ Din said with a shrug. He spoke as if trying to convince himself of something. ‘My idea was that we needed a history of our country written by an Indonesian, something that explored non-standard sources that Westerners could not easily reach. Like folk stories, local mythology, or ancient manuscripts written on palm leaves–’ ‘Lontar, you mean.’ ‘Yes. When you think about the standard approach to history, all the historical texts, you’re really talking about Western sources. It’s as if the history of South-East Asia started with the discovery of the sea routes from Europe to Asia. Everything begins at this point in time, but in fact so much had already happened. The empires of Majapahit and Mataram had been established; Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism…I wanted to retell the story of these islands because I have a theory that their history is beyond the comprehension of foreigners – sorry, you’ll forgive me for saying that, I know–’ ‘Forgiven–’ ‘–and that history has to be told by a voice that is non-Western…’" />

He had a way of making the morsels on his plate seem meagre and almost inedible. There was nothing she could do for him, she thought; perhaps she ought to give up. Perhaps she ought to have given up on this country a long time ago. It was still early in the evening, but she was already tired.‘Let’s go for a drink,’ she said.

The hotel and the fountain are just two of the many projects designed to impress visitors to Jakarta with the city’s dynamism, and were commissioned by Sukarno himself (‘the President’s majestic erections,’ Margaret called them). Not more than two years had passed and already the toilets in the hotel were unpleasant; some of the bulbs in the grand chandelier in the lobby had blown and hadn’t been replaced; the carpets were scarred by cigarette burns and the table linen dyed with old wine stains." />

She had had two martinis already. The first had gone straight to her head and the second had slipped down all too easily. She was trying to make the third one last, but it was difficult; she felt a flush in her cheeks and she wanted to drink quickly. She was already quite light-headed, she knew, but she felt strong again. Din stood with his elbows on the bar, facing away from the room. He stared at the rows of bottles arranged on the mirrored wall facing him, as if examining every single label. He would take only a Coke, no matter how hard Margaret tried to persuade him otherwise. He wouldn’t even drink a Bintang. She was usually sensitive enough not to transgress cultural boundaries – but Din was different. Yes, he was Muslim, but he had lived for three years in Europe, and was not just another unsophisticated small-town Indonesian. If they both had a drink, she thought, the alcohol might help break down the boundaries that remained between them and they would be friends. There was music, a band and a pretty Filipina in a tight white dress singing ‘Solamente Una Vez’ in bright, clear notes, rolling her r’s impeccably while shaking a pair of brightly coloured maracas to accompany the Cuban drums. The bar was not full but it was already very noisy, the air smoky and filled with men’s voices. There were a lot of men here and not many women; not many locals either. The only Indonesians present seemed to be women, and nearly all were prostitutes. ‘Here you have the Occident’s finest at play,’ Margaret said. ‘See those two guys? Pulitzer winners a few years back. They’re supposed to be reporting on one of the most urgent political situations in the world and what do they do? Chase after girls they can’t get at home. And that idiot over there, yes, that one canoodling with the Batak girl, he’s meant to be administering aid for the World Bank, but it doesn’t look as if he’s capable of administering anything but a strawberry daiquiri.’ ‘Do you know everyone here?’ Din asked. ‘I recognise a few faces.’" />

Margaret went over and sat down, making a cursory attempt to fiddle with the bulbs. She preferred everything to be bathed in light, preferably sunlight. It was not that she was afraid of the dark: she just did not like it, for it frustrated her not to be able to make things out clearly. The windows looked out on to narrow streets away from the noise and great rush of traffic of the grand roundabout. There were not so many people here, just a few of the embassy drivers waiting for their bosses to finish dinner. They milled about in small groups, smoking and exchanging gossip. Most of them were smartly dressed in creased trousers and khaki shirts, but there were a number of other locals who were more difficult to place: bodyguards trying to look casual, perhaps, or local journalists bribing the drivers for information. Margaret tried to discern the differences between them. She was good at this, good at spotting what lay behind this Asian mask of inscrutability. She had learnt to do this in the jungle, with tribes who wore real masks and whose body language was indecipherable to outsiders, and she applied it with great success everywhere in Indonesia, even in this city of three million people. In America and Europe she had not been quite so successful; her antennae did not pick up the right signals with other occidentals. She had not really even been able to understand her parents.
	‘So who was your friend earlier?’ Din said, joining her at the table.
	‘What friend?’
	‘That American man.’
	‘Bill Schneider, you mean? He’s not a friend. He works at the Embassy. Not exactly sure what he does – something to do with finance. Well, OK, I think he arranges all the bribes from our wonderful country to your wonderful country to build all your wonderful projects.’
	‘Like this hotel?’
	‘Probably Although I think this hotel might have been funded with Japanese baksheesh – not that it makes any difference. Bill and his lot certainly have their fingers in the pie now. I tell you, that man is everywhere.’
	They watched him drinking a tall glass of beer with a group of friends. He stubbed out his cigarette with clumsy little jabs and punched people on the shoulder to emphasise his jokes. He laughed a lot, always loudly. From across the room they could only catch snippets of what he was saying. ‘…last year the Yankees got unlucky, this year they’re gonna step up…I’m tellin’ ya, you can’t lose with a name like Yogi Berra…’
	‘He can at least speak Indonesian,’ Margaret said, ‘and Russian too, which is a big help in this town.’

	They walked through the grand lobby where smart-looking men in bush jackets and expensive women in shimmering dresses turned to look at them. They stood at the entrance for a moment or two, unsure of how to bid each other goodbye. A kiss? Out of the question. A hug? Still too intimate. Handshake? Too formal.
	‘See you tomorrow, I guess,’ Margaret said, holding up her hand in a stilted wave.
	‘Yes,’ he said, and a smile flashed across his face, not the infuriating unreadable one, but something thinner and tired.

	‘And…?’
	‘And what?’
	‘Well,’ he paused. ‘We need to know what you…think.’
	She did not answer. A steady stream of limousines drew up before them; the revving of the engines and the exhaust fumes made her feel sick, and the whistling of the doormen rang sharply in her ears and made her incipient headache grow worse. She wanted to go home.
	He stood watching her, not saying anything. Margaret felt he was prepared to stay there all night, waiting for her to answer, but in the end he said, ‘I’m sorry. This is not a good place to speak. You sure you won’t come back inside for one more beer? No, you’re tired, of course. Look, come by and see me in my office. Soon.’ He handed her a folded-up newspaper.

It all looked familiar to her – surely she had read it all this morning?

Caught in unseasonally bad weather just south of Cape Varella, it began to move south-eastwards, drifting for many days until, lured by powerful currents, it crashed on the notorious reefs off the rocky shores of Nusa Perdo. Exercising his ancient right of looting shipwrecks, the Sultan immediately ordered his fleet of little boats to recover the precious flotsam from the wreck of the Nan Sing. Enraged by this transgression, the Dutch authorities in Batavia demanded the return of the cargo and ordered the Sultan to submit to Dutch rule. When this was predictably refused, several skirmishes took place, escalating into a stand-off that lasted two days. There followed a further fifty years of shipwrecks, looting and half-hearted attempts by the Dutch army to bring the island under its control. No great energy was expended in the subjugation of Perdo because the island had neither spices nor sandalwood. Covered in scrubby bushes and dominated by a dead volcano, this unobtrusive island virtually disappeared in the constellation of more attractive islands around it, until, late in the century, the discovery of Kayuputih trees and rumours of rich gold deposits brought the white man back to these shores, and this time they did not leave. The Sultan died by his own hand and the island came under Dutch rule.
	No one really knows how the island got its curious name, which does not seem consistent with the rhythms of the (now virtually dead) local dialect. Writing about Muslim sects in the eastern archipelago in the pre-war Revue des Études Islamiques, a French scholar called Gaston Bosquet suggests that the name of this island is a bastardisation of ‘pieds d’or’, a reference to the fascination held by early Western visitors for the shoes of gold cloth worn by the princes of the royal household in the seventeenth century, and to the idea that these explorers might have been walking on fields of gold. Given the relative poverty of this island, however, such explanations seem highly implausible (rumours of gold reserves turned out to be a myth). No more likely – though a touch more romantic – is the idea that members of a Portuguese reconnaissance expedition in the early sixteenth century foundered on the rocky coastline of the island, as so many were to do in the centuries that followed. Marooned hundreds of miles from the shipping channels between Malacca and China, they called this place the Lost Island, Nusa Perdo – a name that continues today. This might also explain why, in town, there are three local merchants whose surnames are Texeira, De Souza and Menezes, even though they look thoroughly Indonesian." />

And this was why he did not look like the other children on the island, why they hated him.
	He often wished that he had the coarse curly hair of the local boys, as well as their sturdy square faces that made them look, well, rudimentary, more suited to the sharp changes of weather on the island. Sometimes, if he stayed out in the sun for too long, the skin on his forearms and knees would begin to smart, as if rubbed with fine sand, and by the end of the day it would feel hot and taut, properly burnt by the sun, just like Karl’s – a foreigner’s skin. On those occasions he wished that he had the other children’s darker, thicker skin that turned to leather by the time they were teenagers, shielding them from the elements. He wished he did not have his straight hair and brittle jawline and fragile cheekbones; he wished he did not stand out quite so much.

But the truth was that life during this time was simple, blissful and untroubled, in a way that can only happen when two people are desperate to achieve happiness. 
	Their days were idyllic and filled with all the things that fathers and sons dream of sharing. They made kites in the shape of birds that sometimes swept effortlessly into the sky but more often crash-landed after the briefest of flights, much to Adam’s and Karl’s amusement; they played takraw in the yard, Adam’s plump legs proving surprisingly adept at juggling the hard rattan ball, Karl less so because of his one weak leg; they hollowed out lengths of driftwood and collected lengkeng seeds to play congkak, a game which Karl explained had been brought to these islands by Arab sea traders many hundreds of years ago; they found an old biscuit tin amongst Karl’s things that contained chess pieces, and drew a chalk chessboard on the floor of the veranda that had to be re-sketched every time the rains swept in and washed it away.
	It was a Spartan happiness, it is true. Sometimes, Karl often told him, it is better not to own things, especially precious things, because they will be lost or taken away; things cannot last beyond your lifetime. Karl did not spend any money on toys, for example, or anything he deemed to be ephemeral or trivial. Once or twice, Adam had paused in front of the glass cabinets at the Chinese store in town, admiring the brightly coloured motorcars and plastic water pistols. ‘No one here can afford these toys,’ Karl had said, gesturing in the vague direction of the villages on the coast, ‘and yet they’re quite happy. We don’t need these things either – we’re just like everyone else.’
	And so they pursued simpler pleasures. Adam learnt to wade into the shallows and, when the sea was calm, he’d paddle out over the reefs with Karl. He would float along quite calmly for a while but then he would be panicked by the enormity of the ocean, the endlessness of its possibilities, and he would start to flail around, desperate to regain the sureness of the shore, until Karl came over and held his hand. His previous world now seemed empty and colourless, but in this world there were kaleidoscopic fish, purple sea urchins and pulsating starfish; and beyond the coral there was the promise of shipwrecks, their silent corpses filled with treasure from a lost time." />

He saw them crouching by the roadside, blinking the dust from their eyes as he swept by in the car.

There were about eighteen or twenty children crammed into the small classroom, all boys, save for one girl whose roughly cropped hair made her look like a boy. One side of her face was obscured by a birth-mark, a purple-red cloud that stretched from her temple to her jawbone. Adam had to stare closely before deciding that she was indeed a girl; she stuck out her tongue and threw a scrunched-up piece of paper at him. The other boys gathered round him and examined the contents of his new canvas satchel: an exercise book with buff-coloured covers, a pocket atlas and a new box of coloured pencils. His classmates tore the pages from his books and folded them into paper airplanes that they launched into the air with sharp spearing motions. Adam watched as bits of the atlas glided past him: the pink-and-green of the United States floated dreamily in circles until it stubbed its nose on the blackboard and fell abruptly to the ground; the whiteness of the Canadian tundra swept out of the window in an arc, into the dusty sunlight; and the silent mass of the Pacific Ocean that Adam loved so much, dotted with islands (Fiji?

	‘Education. You saw those kids at school? What kind of families do you think they come from?’

	‘Poor ones. Farmers or fishermen who can’t read or write, and yet everyone has had to pay to get into that school. They take a small packet of money or a carton of cigarettes to the education officer and beg him to put their child’s name on the school list, and if they don’t have cash they take a goat or some chickens or sacks of rice.

Adam and Neng had just reached the end of the track that led to the main road when they saw a group of boys from school waiting for them, squatting at the edge of the broken tarmac in the shade of a sea-almond sapling.
	‘Hi, friend,’ one of them said, standing up. He had taken his shirt off and tied its arms around his forehead so that it fell down his back like the head-dresses of Arab sheikhs that Adam had seen in books. This boy was bigger than the others, and when he spoke his voice cracked, alternating between a child’s high-pitched squeak and a manly croak. ‘This is the little orphan who lives with that European man. You’re his servant, yeh?’
	‘No,’ Adam said, ‘he’s my father.’
	The older boy threw back his head and laughed. There was a circle of dried-up spittle around his lips.

You lick the shit from his toilet.’ He pushed his fingers into Adam’s collarbone with a rough jabbing motion, making Adam lose his balance; his bicycle fell from his grip and dropped to the ground. The other boys laughed. ‘What a weakling,’ the gang leader said.
	Adam tried to pick himself up but found that his legs had turned to jelly; his face felt hot and he could not speak. Pressure filled his head, and he felt like vomiting. His ears filled with a great rushing noise, the kind you might hear if you are standing on the seashore before a violent storm, when the froth of the waves blanks out all other noise and makes you lose all notion of where you are. He lay on the ground, kicking feebly at the coppery leaves of the sea almond that lay scattered on the ground. The people standing over him seemed blurred, wobbling as though shaken by gusts of wind. He began to shiver.

	‘Anyway,’ he could hear the man-boy’s croaky voice, ‘whatever the white man is to you, he’s rich. He can buy you another bicycle. This one’s nice.’ Adam saw feet moving around him and heard the chain of his bicycle ticking. Someone tugged the strap of his satchel, which came away from his body as if it no longer wanted to belong to him.
	‘Stop!’ Neng shouted. She put her hands under Adam’s armpits and hauled him into a sitting position. ‘This is not fair. Leave the bike or I’ll kick your balls.’
	‘O-oh, look who’s talking,’ the croaky voice said. ‘What you going to do, help this weakling? Look how tiny he is! Look at those little fat legs. He’s not worth getting beaten up over. Right, boys?’ The voice was steadier now, threatening.
	‘At least he can read and write. You’re nearly an adult and you still can’t read.’ Neng was trying to yank Adam into a standing position but Adam’s legs were still weak.
	‘You just want the bike for yourself, that right?’ The man-boy took a step towards Neng; he looked nearly twice as big as she was.
	‘Just leave him alone.’
	The boy raised his hand and hesitated a second before slapping Neng hard. ‘You’re just a dirty foreigner too,’ he said. ‘Look at you, a dirty monster.’ Neng stood blinking at him, as if she had not been struck.
	‘Careful, Yon,’ a smaller boy said in a quiet voice. ‘She’s Madurese. You know what they’re like.’
	‘I don’t care,’ the boy croaked. ‘These bloody foreigners, they come here and all they do is cause trouble, taking our land. They’re going to chase us off our own island soon, there’ll be nothing left for us. There’ll be more of them than us! That’s what my dad says. He’s fed up with them. Need to teach them a lesson from time to time, he says.’
	‘Yon, c’mon, let’s take the bike and go. Don’t get mixed up with the Madurese. They’re big-time trouble.’
	‘But this one’s only a girl. My dad says all Madurese women are prostitutes anyway. The sooner we teach her who’s boss around here, the better.’
	Adam had managed to get up to a half-kneeling position, one leg still trailing on the ground, when he saw Neng raise her knee, swiftly, in one firm, neat motion; it thudded into the boy’s crotch with a loud squashy noise and he crumpled silently to the ground. He put his hand between his legs to protect himself but it was no use. Neng stood over him and continued to kick him in that same spot, sometimes hopping up and down to stamp on his crotch as if putting out a cigarette. His cries cut through the ringing in Adam’s ears and made him feel less sick; it was as if someone had doused Adam with cold water, and he was able to rise slowly to his feet. The other boys had backed off; Neng was straddling the bicycle and ringing its bell. ‘Come on,’ she said gaily to Adam, as if nothing had happened. She patted the horizontal bar in front of her. ‘You sit here, I’ll cycle. OK? Great. Off we go!’" />

The clouds strained the sunlight that fell on the waves, and this made the sea look calm in places but dark and mysterious in others. It was often like this on Perdo, where the slightest shift in the weather could change the very nature of the island. On those days when the sun was high and unflinching the possibility of rain would seem ridiculous, and on rainy days, when water soaked through everything, you might believe that even if the sun were to reappear, it would never be able to dry the moisture from the earth. But there were other days, too – days such as today, when you could feel both the dry dustiness and the heavy moisture that made up the very air on this island.
	Neng produced a banana from her pocket. It was blackened and squashed, the pulp beginning to ooze from its tip where it had been torn from its comb. ‘You look tired,’ she said, handing it to Adam. ‘Eat this. It’ll make you feel better.’
	It was very ripe and mushy and sweet. Adam ate it quickly and wiped the stickiness from his fingers on his shorts. Maybe it was the fresh breeze, maybe it was his imagination, but the trembling in his chest began to subside, his heartbeat calming. He blinked; there was dust in his eyes and he turned his head from the wind. His face was very close to Neng’s now, and he could see the tiny imperfections, the fragile creases of skin on the scar on her face. She was smiling, and stuck out her tongue at him, just as she had done on the day. It was beginning to rain: the first heavy drops of a shower, falling through the leaves above them.
	‘Hey, it’s getting late,’ said Neng. ‘You look tired. I think you should just go home. We’re not far from where you live.’
	‘But I want to go with you – you know, to help you collect your rice.’
	The bicycle slowed to a halt and Adam had to hop off it. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll go on my own. Your father will be worried. Besides, you look really tired. I don’t want to get the blame – I’ve been blamed for enough things already!’ She handed him the bike and began to walk off into the distance, heading away from the coast into the hills. The rain was falling heavily now, an earnest downpour that would not ease up for at least an hour, maybe two. Adam felt a sudden panic at being left behind, and started to follow her. She turned round and said, ‘If you follow me I’ll kick your balls too.’
	He watched her splash through the puddles that were forming on the road; the rain fell like a thick curtain of mist, and within a few seconds she was out of sight." />

Occasionally a gust of wind would sweep raindrops into his eyes and he would have to slow down and blink hard just to see where he was going; his plimsolls were soaked through and his toes felt clammy and gritty. But the rain and wind were not cold, and he was no longer tired. Funny, he thought: at this moment, he didn’t even fear what tomorrow might bring.
	‘Where have you been, son?’ Karl said, rushing to meet him with an enormous towel that he held between outstretched arms, the way the fishermen hold their nets before flinging them out to sea.
	‘Nowhere,’ said Adam, letting Karl towel his hair vigorously. ‘I just took my time. It was…it was raining.’
	With his head wrapped in the darkness of the towel, Adam knew how unconvincing this sounded. For a moment, he considered telling Karl all that had happened. He was doing something wrong, he knew that. He knew he ought to share everything with Karl because Karl did the same for him; Karl had taken him in and shared his whole life with Adam, so why couldn’t Adam do this tiny thing for him? He also knew that if he was going to tell Karl he must do it immediately, otherwise the opportunity would be lost. Two, three, four, five seconds. The moment was gone.
	Adam did not feel bad at all. Now that the moment was over it did not seem as if he had done anything wrong. Karl lifted the towel from his head and draped it across his shoulders, letting it fall around him like a cape. He looked at Adam unblinkingly, waiting for an explanation, but Adam merely stared out at the murky sea.

The coarse earth crunched underfoot, the black volcanic sand sticking to Neng’s bare toes and covering them like tar. She talked endlessly, pointing things out to Adam: a flock of brilliant green parakeets fluttering like giant locusts in the distance; a boulder the shape of a hand with its fingers cut off; the coral reefs which, from up in the hills, resembled a map, a huge watery atlas.
	She told him about herself, too. Her father was in jail because he’d killed someone, she said cheerily. Well, not exactly killed him, but the man he’d had a fight with had died, purely by accident. All Neng’s father had done was hit him; OK, he hit him quite hard, even her mother said so, but still, he wasn’t the only one. There had been lots of men fighting, it was just a street brawl outside the rice merchant, you know, just by the clock tower. But her father was the only one who was still in jail. Just because he’s Madurese. It was so unfair. He didn’t even want to be on this island anyway.
	‘Then why did you come here?’ Adam couldn’t remember where Madura was, but it sounded far away. He tried to remember his lessons at home with Karl, when Karl had shown him where all the big cities and islands of Indonesia were.
	She frowned, looking closely at him with squinted eyes as if she had spotted something nasty on his face. ‘God, you’re dumb. Transmigration. We were forced to, just like everyone else.’
	They had had nothing in Madura; it was an overcrowded island where there were a few cows and too many people who had no food and no work. They had been promised work, she said, in a place where there were few people and much land. The government was building a new pumice mine and there were lots of jobs, and maybe the workers would be given some land of their own. Her parents didn’t even know what pumice was. Don’t worry, the official had told them; we will give you rice to eat every month and your kids will go to school. But the mine was never built. There was no land for them, and often no rice. They’d been in Perdo for three years, but there was no work at all.
	‘What about you?’ Neng asked. ‘Where did you come from?’
	Adam shrugged. He looked around, hoping to see those parakeets again, but there was nothing.
	‘Sorry,’ she said, reaching out and touching him on the elbow. Her scar obscured her cheek and made her look as if she was only smiling with half her face. ‘I forgot you’re an orphan.’
	‘That’s OK,’ he smiled. But he thought to himself: it was not OK. Why did he not know which part of Indonesia he was from? What dialect had his parents spoken? Even orphans had to come from somewhere. It was not that he had never dared ask Karl, but rather that it had never occurred to him to ask. He had known little of his past and cared even less, and he had liked it that way. So why was he now troubled by this lack of knowledge? Suddenly he felt guilty at having missed school without telling Karl.

Neng disappeared behind some rocks, and when Adam caught up he saw that she had crawled into a natural depression sheltered from the sun and the rain, a scooped-out hollow so perfectly formed that it seemed man-made.
	‘Here, look,’ Neng said, showing him a stash of objects. She picked up a small comb made from pink plastic and ran it through her spiky hair. ‘I found it on the road, just lying there waiting for me to pick it up.’
	‘But that’s stealing,’ Adam said, repeating what Karl had once told him.
	‘Don’t be stupid. If something is thrown away, it means its owner doesn’t want it any more – in that case anyone has a right to take it. Idiot.’ She showed him other things she had found: a small motorbike made of tin, rusting where the paint had worn off; a cracked mirror; a book with a frayed paper cover showing a large sea-fish about to be attacked by a diver wielding a knife (there were some words in German, too, but Adam was not able to read them); and a doll with blue eyes and dark curly lashes. Its painted blond hair looked like a scar on its head, an imperfection. Neng picked it up and cuddled it as if it were a real baby, holding its head to her cheek and swaying from side to side; she sat down with her legs crossed and looked out of the miniature cave. They could see over the low trees to the tawny flatlands and the sea in the distance. ‘No one can see me in here,’ she said. ‘It’s my secret place.’ She leant over and kissed him on his cheek and he could smell the musty unwashed odour of her clothes and skin. He blushed, and withdrew slightly; her lips felt funny – dry and hot; he wasn’t sure he liked it. She giggled and continued to cuddle her doll." />

They met a team of scientists who were taking rock samples not far from where Adam lived; they wanted to build a mine, but they did not say what kind. One of them, an American, gave Neng and Adam three dollars each and an old T-shirt that said BERKELEY. Neng said Adam should have the T-shirt. She didn’t want it; she was happy enough as it was, not because of the money, but because her father would finally, FINALLY! have a job in this mine. That was what she kept repeating to Adam as they cycled home. She turned around and made funny faces at him, the bike zigzagging along the road.

There were creases on the paper as if it had been left folded for a very long time.
	‘Happy birthday,’ Karl said, appearing in this doorway. Adam suddenly realised he did not know when his birthday was. At the orphanage there had been no celebrations – at least none that he could remember. ‘I didn’t know when your birthday was so I decided that, from now on, we shall celebrate it on the anniversary of your arrival in this house.’ Adam had not realised that he had spent an entire year there; it seemed only minutes since he’d arrived.
	‘Why are you doing that?’ Adam asked as Karl closed the shutters and door. It was a dull, drizzly morning, the sea mists remaining longer into the morning than usual.
	‘You’ll see,’ Karl said, placing the box on Adam’s bed. ‘Go on, open it.’
	Adam picked nervously at the wrapping paper until he saw a flimsy cardboard box, frayed and torn at the edges. It bore a picture of a curly-haired woman gaily spraying her underarms with deodorant. She wore bright red lipstick to go with her bright red dress and she showed off a bright red flower in her hair.
	‘That’s just the box,’ Karl said, taking it from Adam. ‘Here, I’ll show you.’ He reached inside and produced a glass-like object, not quite a globe. ‘It’s a magic lantern. Let me show you how it works.’ He switched on the table-lamp and placed the lantern on top of it. All at once the walls of Adam’s bedroom faded away and suddenly he was in a forest in Europe. A thicket of pointy trees engulfed his cupboard and from the trees a handsome blond boy emerged, riding a horse that glided over yellow moorland. The sunlit sky swirled over this scene, golden and streaked with fantastic clouds. There was a castle too, honey-coloured, but it was sheared off by a wide arc and faded into pearly blankness.
	‘Sorry, that’s where the disc fits into the lamp,’ Karl said, reaching for the lantern and fiddling with it. For a moment the hollow gloom of Adam’s room returned once more but then, once Karl had adjusted the lantern, the dream resumed. A princess with pale blond hair and a blue gown stood atop the half-castle, pleading with the youth to come to her.
	‘His name is Golo,’ Karl said. He was reclining on the floor, his arms folded behind his head as he stared at the magic sky. And the lovely maiden is called Genevieve. Isn’t she pretty?’
	Adam nodded. He too lay down on his bed and looked at the sky. The rain drummed lightly on the roof and in the distance there was the faint rush of rough seas.
	‘It used to be mine,’ Karl said. ‘I was about your age, I suppose, maybe younger. We had already left Indonesia and were living in The Hague. I had trouble sleeping. Every night there was a scene. My nanny – my Dutch nanny – would come into my bedroom and put the magic lantern on for me. I loved Golo, I wanted to be him. I would lie in bed hoping my mother would come and kiss me goodnight. I’d imagine her saying, “All right, my child, I’ll kiss you once last time, like Genevieve, but then you must go to sleep.” She never came, but at least I had my magic lantern to make me feel better.’" />

He felt a bitter numbness that seemed familiar, as if left over from his Past Life in the orphanage, and he knew he had to blank it out before it took hold. He took a deep breath and counted slowly from one to ten. He had to eliminate this feeling from his New Life.
	‘Good night, my son,’ Karl said, opening the door and breaking up the forest. ‘I know you’ve been having a difficult time, but just remember, we’re very lucky people. I hope you’ve had a nice birthday.’
	Adam nodded as Karl turned the light out. ‘Wait,’ Adam said quietly in the darkness. ‘What day is it today? What’s my birthday?’
	Karl paused at the door. ‘It’s August seventeenth.’
	Later Adam would learn that August 17th was also Independence Day. On his birthday there would always be rousing songs on the radio as well as the President’s speech, the whole of which Karl would insist they listen to. There would be red-and-white flags hanging from the eaves of houses, and in the evening there would be festivities in the villages – food and dancing – that continued late into the night. Before he went to bed Adam would put on his magic lantern and stare at the swirling scenes that he knew so well, and he would listen to the far-off sounds of laughter and smell the faint sweetness of grilled meat and charcoal smoke that carried on the sea breeze.

There was silence, as if the person on the other end was holding their breath too, and the air in her bedroom began to feel stifling. The line clicked and went dead. ‘Probably just the exchange playing up again,’ she said aloud. The sound of her own voice reassured her, and she began humming to herself, a vacuous tune that she soon realised was the song she’d heard at the Hotel Java the night before. Somehow, she knew the phone would ring again, and this time she would not be so cowardly." />

	‘Hell-o,’ she said loudly, challenging the mystery caller.
	There was a half-second’s pause. ‘Margaret?’ Din’s voice sounded timid, almost scared.
	‘Yes, hi, Din, it’s Margaret here. Did you try calling me earlier? Just a second ago?’
	‘Um, no,’ he said. ‘Are you OK?’
	‘Sure,’ she said, sliding her feet into her shoes. She was sure it was he who had rung, it must have been. ‘You recovered from the horror of last night?’
	‘It was interesting, actually, I was thinking about it on the way home. I’m glad you took me along. Maybe we’ll do it again some time.’
	‘Sure. Maybe.’
	‘Are you sure everything’s all right?’
	‘Why shouldn’t it be all right?’
	‘Well, it’s just, you’re always on time, that’s all. You’re usually here before me, so I thought I’d ring you to see if you were OK.’
	‘What do you think might have happened? That I might have fallen prey to a wanton taxi driver? I just overslept, that’s all.’
	Din did not answer for a while. Margaret imagined his inscrutable smile. ‘OK then,’ he said calmly, ‘maybe I’ll see you later.’
	‘Yeah, maybe.’ She let the phone fall into its cradle with a crash and walked into the sitting room. The swirling green faux-marble Formica tabletop was half-covered in bits of paper and photographs.

She had not seen them for a very long time, and it had taken her a while even to remember where the box was. She had recovered it in the small storeroom into which she threw everything that she did not use on a daily basis, things that collected in layers as the years went by. And so, working her way through the archaeological dig of her life, she had found it preserved like a rare fossil in the pre-adult period, buried under old college textbooks but lying (more or less) on top of a box labelled Childhood in New Guinea. Once consigned to this storeroom, things rarely resurfaced; geckos laid their eggs on the spines of books and mice crawled into boxes to die. Margaret had no idea why she had spent a good hour and a half on her hands and knees, struggling with the flashlight wedged between her chin and shoulder, to free this box from its tomb of memories. She had looked at the pictures until it was very late, until she was alone in the night, when even the scooters and dogs and radios had fallen silent. She had been surprised to see how little she had changed, and had felt an unexpected surge of happiness when she recognised herself in the pictures. She had grown older, of course, but the similarities between the fifteen-year-old Margaret and the forty-something Margaret were obvious: the slight, adolescent build, the firm unfleshy arms, the hair pulled back neatly from the face, the chin raised in a perpetual challenge, the pouting smile. It was definitely Margaret.

She had found him in a room that stank of disinfectant in a nursing home on the outskirts of Ithaca, his face pale and mottled, bleached of colour. The few wisps of hair on his head had grown too long and fell like threads of fine white silk across the scabs on his scalp. He looked like just another old man, like the ones playing cards in the hall. He was barely sixty but the cancer had taken hold.
	When he smiled she felt a terrible pain in her chest; she had never believed that sadness could be a physical sensation. During that brief weak smile, she had recognised her father, the one whose image she had always kept in her mind’s eye. And she was glad when he closed his eyes again, for he became an old man once more, someone foreign whose pain, too, was foreign to her." />

The picture only became fuzzier, its indistinct dots revealing no further clues. There was one white man in the crowd of twenty Indonesian ones, that was for sure. They were in a cell, or the back of a dark room. The flash of the camera had surprised a few of them; their faces were raised open-mouthed and dazed, looking straight at the viewer. The others just sat cross-legged, their heads bowed to their chests. Right at the back, the solitary white figure sat calmly with his back propped up against the wall, his head turned at an angle as if examining something on his leg. A small part of his neck was revealed, like a fragment of a precious mosaic, and Margaret studied it at length; the slight curve of it was unmistakeable – or was she just imagining the similarity? She had spent most of the night comparing the photo in the newspapers to her old photos but could not reach a conclusion." />

Along the shady lanes near her house the drains were no longer overflowing but filled with shallow puddles of oily water, blocked by dams of rubbish rotting slowly in the heat. Two mangy dogs picked listlessly through the tangle of tin cans and empty sacks and vegetation as Margaret walked past a row of shop-houses, their bamboo blinds lowered against the sun. A hundred and fifty years ago, when Dutch Batavia was at its zenith, these shops contained sacks of spices and tea and fragrant wood bound for Europe where there was no limit to their prices; this was the port from which European fantasies were stoked to frenzied extremes, but you could sense none of the past glory in the streets of Old Jakarta. The voices of prosperous merchants did not echo in the narrow lanes, the clink of gold coins had disappeared a century ago. Even in the south of the city, in the place that some people called ‘New’ Jakarta, Margaret could see only decay. She had witnessed its growth, the simple, functional houses built seemingly overnight, stretching in rows like crops, punctuated by enclaves of big houses, where the roads suddenly widened and high cement walls hid immense Western-style mansions, the bright terracotta tiles on their faux-Tuscan roofs just visible above the walls. But everything aged so quickly here, Margaret thought; Jakarta had a way of dragging everything into its slimy mess, of making new things look old. Moss grew on surfaces of smooth cement; the sun and the rain wore down metal and stone and made them look dirty. In Jakarta she could never really escape the feeling of being in a slum." />

She flagged down a jeep-taxi in front of the porticoes of the once-handsome, almost-derelict old City Hall, watched by a group of soldiers who huddled in the shade of a wooden lean-to, sharing a kretek between them. ‘Hey, lady, got a cigarette?’ one of them shouted out without much enthusiasm, as if anticipating Margaret’s cursory shake of the head. She knew he wanted Marlboros or Camels, proper cigarettes, not the cheap kretek he and his friends were smoking. Not long ago she’d always carried a pack of Lucky Strikes with her. You could bribe anyone with American cigarettes. That was the curious thing about the human animal, she thought: even in times of famine they would sooner reach for luxuries than a sack of rice. A stick of tobacco laced with noxious chemicals was worth more than a meal for a child, that was why she’d always had cigarettes with her, but they had become so difficult to buy, so expensive, even for a foreigner.
	The jeep jerked its way through the traffic, heading slowly south to the heart of modern Jakarta. The weather was on the turn now: the damp air of the monsoon season was beginning to blow into the city, the risk of heavy thunderstorms growing with each week. For the past few months the winds had been dry and dusty, the moisture bleached from the city, every object like tinder, ready to catch fire. Sometimes the air was so dry it was hard to believe that this city lay on the coast of a tropical island. The flimsy houses in the slums they now passed reminded Margaret of dead leaves on a bonfire, heaped up on top of one another, waiting for a single match or smouldering cigarette butt. There were always fires in the slums in the dry season, and every week for the last three months she had passed the blackened remains of houses, charred fragments of timber and corrugated iron, that just lay there, day after day, becoming part of the cityscape. And yet in a few weeks’ time they would be damp and slimy from the blocked-up drains and the pools of stagnant grey water that collected after the rains, and Margaret would forget the desiccating heat of August. How quickly we forget, she said to herself, how quickly we forget.

The giant rectangular box was made from smooth grey concrete; it had shiny glass in the windows and a façade of fashionable honeycomb shapes. Air conditioners hummed faintly behind closed doors as she crossed the immense foyer, her sneakers squeaking on the shiny terrazzo floor. Behind a semi-circular desk a security guard dozed in his chair, his head hanging limply to one side, his hands clutching a thin exercise book to his belly. There was no one else about; a solitary swallow fluttered aimlessly against the vaulted ceiling, desperately trying to find its way back out of the building. Margaret continued until she reached the back door, re-emerging into the heat. In the shadow of the big new building stood an older, smaller one, its timber upper floor giving it the air of a village house. There was hardly any space between the two structures – no lawn or yard, just a narrow drain. Typewriters clacked without enthusiasm in the stillness of the afternoon as Margaret went up the creaky wooden stairs. The radio was on, broadcasting one of the President’s speeches – a repeat, Margaret noticed – his voice urgent, persuasive, utterly convincing." />

The shutters were open but here in the shadow of their enormous neighbour there was never much light, just a perpetual gloom.
	‘Hello, Sailor,’ she said.
	‘My dear god,’ one of the men said, leaning back in his chair, ‘it’s Jakarta Jane, sweetheart of the forces. To what do we owe this most splendid honour?’
	‘Nothing, just thought I’d pop by to say hello,’ Margaret said, easing herself into a chair.
	‘I’ve never known Margaret Bates to “pop by” to say hello. What do you want?’ He had an open smile, his youthful face surprisingly creased with lines. He was a thick-set man with broad hairy forearms and thick agricultural fingers that looked thoroughly unsuited to writing or typing.
	‘Do I detect a note of cynicism there, Mick?’
	‘Not a note, a whole goddamn symphony. Rudy – get Margaret a beer, will you? And one for yourself too. In fact, one for everyone. We need no further excuse for a beer now that Margaret Bates is here.’
	The other man, a stout young Indonesian, retrieved three bottles of Krusovice from a fridge that stood against a bare wall like a piece of modern art. He brought one over to Margaret, bowing slightly as he did so.
	‘Hey, Rudy, did you know that Sukarno himself tried to get her to bed? He had such a hard-on for her.’
	‘Do shut up, Mick.’ Margaret smiled and accepted the cold bottle of beer. Her headache had faded to a dull throb and she was feeling hot, dehydrated. ‘That was so long ago.’
	‘Ah-ha! You admit it!’
	She turned to Rudy. ‘Just ignore him. It’s all rumours. You know what you boys are like, forever looking for scandal. Journalists will be journalists – especially if they’re Australian.’
	Rudy shrugged his shoulders indifferently, but continued looking at Margaret.
	‘I had another job back then, it was different. I met the President a few times at official functions,’ Margaret began to explain, without knowing why she felt the need to. ‘He seemed to like me, and he remembered me. You know what powers of memory he has. I was friendly with his staff, so journalists used to ask me to arrange appointments at the Palace. All these dirty boys–’
	Mick put the bottle to his lips with comic lasciviousness, his tongue curling outwards.
	‘–started a rumour. You know the President’s reputation with women. Well, just for the record, he was always very correct with me.’

	Margaret picked up a slim, loosely bound book from Mick’s desk and began flicking through it – a collection of Chairil Anwar’s translations of Rilke. ‘Do you find him faithful to the original?’
	‘He’s better with Gide. With Rilke it’s like he’s trying too hard, like he wants to be in tune with Rilke. There’s no such clunkiness with Gide, it’s like they know each other. Anwar would have been great with Rimbaud. They’ve so much in common – that unfettered lifestyle, don’t-give-a-damn hair…Shame he never discovered him. They’d have been the perfect couple.’

	‘He gave me this.’ She handed over the page which she had torn from the newspaper. ‘Have you heard anything?’
	He looked at the page briefly. ‘What’s so special? There’s a civil war brewing, darling. Commies are being arrested and killed all the time – even in godforsaken little islands. Where is Perdo? Never even heard of it.’
	‘Look at the picture carefully. There’s a European in there. Just there,’ she said, stabbing at a spot on the page with her finger. ‘That’s not usual. There aren’t that many foreigners hanging around in Indonesia, Mick. One of your sources must know something about this.’
	Mick picked up the paper and looked at it again, holding it up at an angle to catch the dim light. ‘Why did Bill Schneider give you this?’
	Margaret shrugged. ‘Beats me.’
	‘It’s someone you know, isn’t it?’
	‘Uh-uh,’ Margaret shook her head. ‘No idea who it is.’ She did not know why she lied.
	Mick smiled as he put the bottle of beer to his mouth. ‘Hmmm.’
	‘Honest,’ Margaret said, trying to sound bright (she was good at sounding bright, she told herself, she was even better at being flippant). She retrieved the piece of paper and re-folded it neatly. ‘I just thought, well, this poor guy’s out there, stranded, his Embassy probably doesn’t even know, he’s about to be flung in jail or even worse, a shallow grave along with lots of communists. I guess Schneider just thought that with the contacts I have – well, used to have – I might be able to do something. But I can’t. It’s not the same any more.’
	Mick did not reply; a moment of silence passed between them, the staccato tapping of Rudy’s typewriter the only noise in the airless afternoon. Margaret looked down at the folded piece of paper in her lap. The newsprint was blurring and the paper itself was becoming oily and limp from the humidity and the moisture on her fingertips. She wanted to reach for her bottle of beer, but suddenly the simple act of stretching out for it seemed impossibly difficult. Her head began to hurt again, the heavy numbness giving way once more to waves of stabbing pain in her temples. ‘I mean,’ she said at last, quietly, ‘I just don’t get mixed up in that kind of thing any more.’
	Mick smiled and said, ‘Your beer’s getting warm.’
	‘Please, Mick, can you help me? I need to find this man. I feel I need to do something.’
	‘Dear old Margaret, always the do-gooder.’ He frowned and ran both hands through his dark wavy hair, rubbing his scalp as if he had an itch. ‘I don’t know, it’s getting difficult for our guys to gather information. Even our local fixers get in trouble with the army. There are soldiers everywhere, looking for trouble. Worst thing is that we don’t have enough cash to bribe everyone. We haven’t got enough money coming through from the US channels. CBS doesn’t use me any more, the BBC’s gone silent. ARTC are the only ones coming up with the goods for me right now. I just don’t know, Margaret.’
	‘Please.’
	Mick sighed.
	‘For old times?’
	‘We never had any old times, you heartbreaker.’
	She stood up and tried hard to smile. ‘Oh, we would have gotten married and had twelve kids, if only you didn’t’ – she mouthed – ‘like boys.’
	‘Oh, you wound me. I die, I faint, I fail.’

There were more people about now, neatly dressed office workers carrying piles of papers as they walked unhurriedly across the lobby of the building. They glanced at Margaret with sleepy, bloodshot eyes. Some of the women were wearing the jilbab, their heads covered in scarves that came down to their waists, shrouding their slight torsos and revealing only their calm powdered faces. Margaret became aware that the squeaking of her sneakers was the only noise she could hear echoing in the cool emptiness of the space. She could hear no one else’s footsteps, and even the distant drone of the air conditioning had fallen silent.
	Outside, the city was white and dusty with heat. She put on her sunglasses and began to walk. ‘Hey, lady,’ men called out, ringing the bells of their becaks to get her attention. She moved away, ignoring them. She wanted to walk; she wanted to move her body and clear her mind and not succumb to this immovable pain in her head. She continued past the dirty white façade of the Catholic cathedral, its spires rising forlornly into the sky. There was a thin patch of fresh whitewash on the walls next to the entrance, but she could still read the messy red graffiti underneath: Crush Christian Imperialists.
	‘Hey, lady, hey,’ the becak drivers called. ‘Hey, pretty lady. Oi! ’ A group of three or four of them followed her in their shaded rickshaws, shouting incessantly. Suddenly their cries were all she could hear. The sound of the cars and the buses and scooters faded into a vague, distant roar, like the sound of the sea as you approach the coast but cannot yet see the water. She had to get away from these men, she thought, and crossed the road, wading calmly into the traffic, picking her way westwards to the barren expanse of Merdeka Square. She headed towards the construction site of the soon-to-be National Monument. The gigantic column was pushing slowly into the sky, its thick base shrouded in scaffolding. Monstrous pieces of machinery lay scattered around it, silent and unused like ruins of a lost civilisation. The earth in the square was bare and easily turned to mud by the heavy rains of the monsoon, but now, after a few months without rain, it was crumbling to dust, and she kicked up little red clouds as she walked briskly along in the heavy heat.

Stupid to come out without a hat, she thought, but she was not a delicate white flower that wilted under the sun. She marched on through this deserted island in the middle of the swirling city, trying to ignore her headache. A mangy dog trotted alongside her for a few moments and then sloped off to find shelter. In the distance, in the meagre shade of a spindly acacia, she noticed two boys, shirtless, their backs propped up against the tree trunk. She was not in the mood for hassle, but a quick glance confirmed that there was nowhere to go: all around her there was just a great emptiness with no pathways to divert her trajectory, no cover, no excuse to change direction. Besides, she thought, if she changed tack now they would spot her and know that she was avoiding them, and then they would come after her. She knew this for certain; she had lived here so long and knew these people so well that she could predict what would happen. The best thing to do was to carry on as if they were not there. They might be too lazy or tired to harass her. They were just kids: what could they do? In any case she must show that she was not afraid.
	‘Hey, cutey,’ they shouted as she went past. She noticed at once that they did not call her ‘Auntie’ or ‘Mother’ or any other respectful term by which she was often addressed by young men. She should have been flattered but wasn’t; she carried on briskly. Instantly, they were at her side, flanking her as she lengthened her stride. Their frames were slight, even fragile at first glance, yet Margaret saw that they had the expressions and wiry musculature of older boys. Quickly she determined their age: fourteen or fifteen, old enough to be dangerous.
	‘Hey – Dutch? British? American? Give us money, US dollars.’ They spoke with the rough accents of the Bimanese or Sasaks; these boys were from the outer islands, not Jakarta.
	She continued looking straight ahead. ‘I don’t have any money with me. If I did I would give you some, but I don’t. Now go away, leave me alone.’
	Thrown by her fluency in Indonesian, they were quiet for a moment. ‘One dollar,’ one of them said, holding up his index finger. ‘Just one dollar.’
	‘No.’
	‘OK, rupiah. You have rupiah.’
	‘I told you, I have no money.’ They were still a long way from the edge of the square, a long way from the sea of traffic in the distance.
	The first boy stepped in front of her and stopped dead. ‘You’re lying.’
	He stood very close to her, looking straight into her face. He had a scar running across his forehead, a purple-white streak against the almost iridescent bronze of his skin. The pungent odour of his sweat filled Margaret’s nostrils and she could almost feel the sticky heat from his body. She looked him straight in the eye and was glad for the extra protection of her sunglasses. ‘I am telling you to leave me alone.’
	His face broke into an ugly sneer, his lips parting to reveal surprisingly strong white teeth. ‘Why?’
	‘Because I say so.’
	‘So what? Give me rupiah.’
	‘No.’
	Out of the corner of her eye she saw another three or four youths jogging towards them, street kids, just like these two, shirtless and barefoot. She moved to one side and resumed walking, faster now: she had to get to the edge of the square.
	There were bodies around her, but she kept striving for the road, for the noise of the traffic. Someone reached out and touched her, a hot clammy hand on her bare forearm. Don’t run, she told herself, don’t run. There was a tug at her shirt, then a pinch on the side of her stomach. She broke into a run, kicking up a cloud of dust. The low roar of the traffic grew louder and she heard someone shout out behind her, a single sharp adolescent’s cry, but she did not turn back until she had reached the side of the great wide road with the comforting cacophony before her. She was breathing hard: she could not remember the last time she had had to run. She hurried across the road, enjoying the angry beeping of the scooters, and when she reached the other side she looked across at the square. Suddenly it seemed far away and unthreatening, shrouded in a veil of dust.
	She blinked. The sun had begun to fall from its midday peak, the light becoming silvery and blurred through the thick haze of exhaust fumes and dust. The shapes of the boys in the distance shimmered in the heat, floating, it seemed, on a watery surface. ‘Margaret Bates,’ she said aloud, wanting to hear her voice: it sounded hoarse and slightly shaky. ‘Pull yourself together. Right now.’ It was nothing serious, she told herself. You let your guard down for a second and when you do that in a city like Jakarta you’ll get into scrapes, Margaret Bates, you know that full well. It’s no big deal.

The white paint of the house had faded to a dirty grey; the columns that divided its façade into neat squares were carved with graffiti, and swiftlets nested in the eaves. Shaded by rain trees, the building felt ancient and damp, and the cool darkness of its deep verandas instantly made Margaret feel better.
	‘Good afternoon,’ the woman at the reception said to her, standing up quickly as if she recognised Margaret, as if she had been expecting her.
	‘I was wondering if I could look through the old issues of whatever newspapers you have – not that old, in fact, quite recent.’
	‘Of course,’ the woman said. She wore a neat beige knee-length skirt and a white blouse. Pinned on her shirt was a plastic brooch of a bumblebee with a smiley face, and in her perfectly straight hair there was a hair-band of the same yellow as the bumblebee’s cheerful cheeks. ‘This way, please.’
	Margaret followed her into a large sombre room that smelled of camphor and damp wood. No one else was in the reading room, and most of the bookshelves were empty, or else stacked with nondescript cardboard boxes. There were no windows on the ground floor; above them was a narrow gallery decorated with cheap modern oil paintings of cockfights and buffaloes and paddy fields. The arched windows of the gallery were dirty and stained, and panels of glass missing here and there.
	‘It is all ready for you, over there,’ the woman said, pointing at a recess at the far end of the room.
	‘But I need something quite specific,’ Margaret said.
	The woman smiled a broad toothy smile that looked unnervingly like the bumblebee’s. ‘You will find it all there.’
	The alcove was in fact larger than she had thought, and dominated by a table on top of which various newspapers had been arranged in neat piles: the Harian Rakyat, Indonesia Raya, Sinar Harapan. It looked as if they had been specially laid out in the hope that she would come along and consult them. She settled down to a pile of Harian Rakyat from the mid-fifties. Ten years did not seem like such a long time and yet the font and indeed the writing style seemed archaic to her, so innocent and free. The pages were brittle and yellowed and foxed by the humidity, and the few pictures that appeared in them were as blurred as Impressionist paintings. She squinted in the dim light: maybe she needed glasses. Every time she came upon an article on the repatriation of Dutch citizens she paused, searching for names or faces. She had no idea which names or faces she was looking for, but she knew that sooner or later she would come across something that would help her.
	‘Here you are, madam.’ Margaret looked up and saw the bumblebee smiling at her. The woman put a glass of almost fluorescent iced syrup on the table next to Margaret and went away again. Margaret hesitated, but she was suddenly very thirsty. She sipped it cautiously at first, and, finding it not as sweet as it looked, finished it in a few gulps.

All other Dutch Indonesians should have done the same but they didn’t have the courage. I had no hesitation. For nearly ten years I have only spoken Bahasa Indonesia. I can’t even speak Dutch any more! The only regret I have is that sometimes I speak to people and I can see in their eyes that they think I’m Dutch, not Indonesian.’ When asked about other former Dutch contacts who might still be in Indonesia, such as de Willigen, he says, ‘I have had no contact with them for years.

Trapped in the maze of dead-ends and unnamed streets, she could not see tower blocks or concrete monuments or glass statues; and under the cover of night the decay of the buildings around her became less noticeable, making the city seem gentler, more human.
	Further north the old square was quiet and empty now, the colonnades of the great buildings filled with a deep gloom. The soldiers she had seen earlier were gone, replaced by people trying to find a place to sleep. Suddenly she was eager to get home, and glad she was not far. She longed for a cold shower, a proper modern American one with powerful jets of water that would strip the dust and grime from her hair and face and make her skin tingle when she stepped into it, but instead she knew that she would have to stand under the dribble of her makeshift shower that consisted of a hose and a watering can. The water would be tepid, heated in its thin pipe by the sun, but still, it would be good enough.

He would be agitated by the smallest thing: the mewing of the fat white cat outside his window, or the squeaking of his bed-frame every time he turned over on the too-thin mattress, or his cupboard door that never closed properly – things he would not normally have noticed. He was irritated by Karl, too – by his uneven club-footed gait, by the pinky-whiteness of his skin which seemed obtrusive against the dull green landscape and, above all, by the way Karl sometimes mumbled to himself: indistinct words in an indistinct language under his breath without even realising he was doing it. ‘Was I talking to myself again?’ Karl would say, clearing his throat and attempting to laugh whenever he noticed Adam glaring at him. ‘Just a silly poem I remember from a long time ago.’ But it did not matter what he said, for Adam would try to ignore this, but as soon as the dreadful half-whisper started, Adam felt a curious sensation in his head, a pinprick that welled up quickly into a hot, almost burning feeling that filled his skull, pressing especially insistently behind his eye sockets. He would no longer be able to read or concentrate on what he was doing and would be so overcome by this pressure in his head that he would have to retreat to his bedroom. There, on his bed with his pillow over his face, he would still be able to hear Karl’s voice.
	As if guilty by association, Karl’s music soon began to annoy Adam too. It made no difference what it was: the moment Karl moved towards the record player, Adam’s back would stiffen. Violins that had previously thrilled him now sounded harsh and screeching; operatic voices, amusing before, were suddenly ridiculous. Adam took to leaving the house altogether. Heading for the sea, he would clamber over the rocks and make his way as far up the shoreline as possible until even the faintest strains of Karl’s dying heroines were drowned out by the hush of the waves. One or two outrigger canoes would be floating on the steel-blue sea, their sails trembling gently in the breeze; small nets would be flung from the boats, the fishermen hauling in meagre catches of mackerel and skipjack and anchovies. Adam would sit watching until his head felt clear and calm once more, the anger draining from his body.
	‘What’s wrong with you? Why are you so angry?’ Karl called out after him the first time he got up and left the room, mid-aria, and ran down to the sea. That was what it was, this thing that filled his head: anger. Until this moment, since beginning his New Life with Karl, Adam had never truly known what it was to feel angry. He wondered whether this anger meant that he was somehow changing, and if so, how. He would lie awake in bed thinking, Why am I angry? and, finding no answer, would become angrier still." />

Every so often someone would drop out of school to work in the ricefields or help with the nets, and Adam would learn that their father had drowned at sea or their mother had died in childbirth; now they were an orphan. On this island it seemed entirely normal to have lost at least one parent. But one day they had a new teacher, a young Sasak who had studied at the Universiteit van Indonesie. He taught them the difference between orphans who had lost one parent and those who had lost both. There was a word that distinguished the two: piatu.

They sat down to their meal: over-cooked mutton curry and rice.
	‘Not hungry, son?’
	Adam did not answer; he did not even bother to shake his head. With his spoon he built mounds of rice on his plate and then mashed them into the shallow pool of curry before rebuilding and remashing them. The edge of his plate was decorated with faded purple flowers whose stems disappeared into the brown swamp that Adam had created.
	‘Adam,’ Karl said, ‘please don’t play with your food. A lot of people on this island are surviving on one meal every three days, and I mean one meal of rice mixed with tapioca.’
	Adam dabbed at the curry. He found a morsel of meat and tried to cut it using the side of his spoon, but the mutton was tough, full of tendons.
	‘Use a knife, Adam, you’re making a mess.’
	Adam went to the kitchen and returned with a blunt butter knife. He began to saw at the piece of mutton listlessly, as if he had already given up.
	‘Please,’ Karl said, ‘don’t hold your knife like that. Put it between your thumb and forefinger – you’re not holding a pencil.’
	Adam looked straight ahead, avoiding Karl’s gaze and glaring instead at the piano. Then he smacked the knife down on the table, catching the side of his plate and upending a thick glob of curry onto the linoleum tablecloth. He felt his eyes well up with hot tears, his head prickling with that burning sensation that he now knew to be anger; and this time the anger seeped downwards too, filling his chest and belly.
	‘Don’t you leave the table, Adam,’ Karl said, his voice still calm. ‘You’re going to stay here and finish the meal that you are lucky to have. If there is something you are not happy about, say it – but don’t you dare leave food on the table.’
	Adam had already risen, his chair pushed back, his hands clutching the side of the table. He remained in this state of limbo for some time, making no attempt to wipe away the thick streams of tears flowing down his cheeks.
	‘I want to know,’ he said at last. ‘I want to know about my family.’
	Karl sighed. He placed his fork gently on the edge of his plate and then leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. He held up his hands and looked at his palms, intently, as if trying to decipher the secrets of his own life. He lowered his face into his hands and sighed again. ‘I found you at the orphanage, that’s all. You know the whole story. There’s nothing more to tell.’
	Adam looked away from Karl. ‘Everyone has a history, you told me that yourself. I want to know about my life – my real life.’
	‘But this,’ Karl said, gesturing weakly with both hands at the space around him, ‘this is your life. Isn’t this enough?’
	There was no breeze that evening. The rose-coloured lace curtains over the always-open windows did not stir. Adam stared at their pattern of chrysanthemums and palm leaves. The room suddenly felt airless and utterly still.
	‘Your mother was not local.’ Karl spoke in a measured monotone, as if he had rehearsed saying these words a thousand times before. ‘Some people said they had seen a fair-skinned woman in the village the day before you were found. She had the complexion of a Sumatran or a Malay and she spoke differently, with a big-city accent – Jakarta, some people thought, but no one was sure; it was difficult to understand what she was saying. Someone asked her where she had come from and she said, “From a place far away.” She asked directions to the orphanage. She had a baby. It was so silent and still that some people thought it was dead. There was a toddler too, a little boy with glassy eyes that never blinked. The villagers saw the woman walking along the paths leading out to the hills, along the ricefields that were very green that year. The next day she was gone and there were two children at the orphanage. This is all I know.’
	Adam noticed that he had, quite suddenly, become curiously clearheaded and calm. His breathing had slowed down to a bare whisper. He wondered why he could not react more powerfully to what he had just heard – it did not seem like a revelation but a mere affirmation of something he already knew; it confused him that he should feel soothed, not agitated, by this news.
	‘So she went back to Jakarta,’ he said eventually.
	‘I haven’t a clue. She could just as well have been from Surabaya or Medan or even Singapore. This is what they told me when I came to the orphanage. They mentioned nothing else – no father, nothing.’ Karl reached across and laid his hand on Adam’s arm; Adam felt it on his skin, cold and clammy and heavy. ‘Son, please believe me, that is all I know.’
	‘What about,’ Adam said, hesitating, ‘what about my brother?’
	‘They say he was taken somewhere far away – Kuala Lumpur, they thought. The people who adopted him did not want to say where they were taking him.’
	Adam looked at Karl’s furrowed brow and tired, red eyes. He moved from the table and felt Karl’s grip on his arm loosen and fall away limply. Karl remained at the table staring blankly at the remnants of their dinner that lay on the chipped china plates, illuminated by the stark light of the single bulb hanging low over the table. It was as if they both knew that by the next morning Adam would be gone, and there was nothing Karl could do to stop him." />

While sweeping the yard he summoned a vast flat plain circled by distant hills; while feeding the chickens he painted an aquamarine sky, troubled by rich rain clouds. After dinner he would hurry to bed, longing for that intense, magical hour during which he could return to the focal point of his Jerusalem: a neat modern bungalow with whitewashed brick walls, a roof of red-clay tiles and a compound filled with plants in pots. This was the house in which his mother lived. There were a few cats – sleek blue-grey ones – which his mother would pick up now and then and caress. There was a child too – his brother Johan – but it was more difficult for Adam to picture this boy, who resisted Adam’s attempts to bring him to life and so remained consigned to the shadows. Adam concentrated instead on building the streets around his mother’s house. They were clean and modest, busy with scooters and becaks and bicycles, lined with houses like his mother’s, simple and unadorned, lived in by decent people; but beyond this unsullied heart the city grew darker, murky with unseen danger. There were wide avenues that stretched into the distance, running into nothingness; there were great silvery buildings full of people doing things that Adam could not comprehend; there were areas of brilliant colourful light and slums where there was no light at all. Sometimes the streets were full of urchins and millionaires, sometimes there would be no one.

The boat that lay just beyond the jetty seemed too flimsy to withstand the crossing to Java. It must once have been painted gaily in greens and yellows, but only a few curled flakes of paint still clung to the dark slimy timber. Its single deck was already full of people, but the crowd nonetheless insisted its way forward, bottlenecking at the gangway. There was no shouting, no agitation, just an eerie hum of voices as people tried to force their way onto the boat. Adam could not understand. There were men reaching across from the edge of the boat to take children whose mothers held them out pleadingly, and occasionally a bag would be tossed from the crowd onto the boat, from invisible owner to unidentifiable recipient.
	Adam noticed a boy standing next to him. He was older than Adam and wore a clean T-shirt with a bright orange globe on it; he did not look like the other boys hanging around the docks. ‘You’ll want to hurry or you’ll miss your chance to go across,’ he said.
	Adam squinted, shielding his eyes from the sun.
	‘Everyone’s leaving because of the drought. They think it’s better over there, over in the big cities where there are foreigners, but it isn’t.

It’s one big turd, this whole country!’ he shouted in the general direction of the ferry and giggled. ‘There’s no escape!’
	Adam began to move away.
	‘Hey, do you want to get on board?’
	‘No thanks,’ Adam said. ‘I’ll come back tomorrow.’ He did not know how he would achieve this; he had no idea where he would sleep or eat or hide from the crowds: tomorrow seemed an eternity away.
	‘It will be the same story tomorrow, my friend,’ the boy said, catching up with Adam, ‘and the day after and the day after and the day after. But listen, I can get you on board.’
	Adam stopped and looked at this boy. He looked normal, just like Adam. ‘How?’
	‘I know people here. People who can get you on board.’
	‘Really?’
	‘Sure. All it takes is a bit of money. You have money, don’t you? We don’t need much – enough for a pack of cigarettes, plus something for me. Hey, fair’s fair, isn’t it? I’m only asking for some coffee-money, no more.’
	Adam hesitated but found himself nodding.
	‘Don’t worry, I like you. You’re my newest friend! Don’t give me anything now. When you get on the boat, a friend of mine will come and find you. I’ll tell him you’re my buddy – just give him enough cash to buy some kretek. How about that? My god, you’re so helpless, look at you. OK, don’t worry, don’t give him anything. We’ll do it for free. This is your lucky day – we’ll do you a favour. Just remember, if you ever get to Jakarta and make it big, remember me: Sunny.’ He pointed at the logo on his T-shirt. ‘That’s me, unmissable, unforgettable, just like the sun.’
	‘Thank you,’ Adam said. ‘But how do I get on the boat?’
	‘OK,’ Sunny said, putting his hand round Adam’s shoulders, guiding him back towards the overcrowded jetty. His voice dropped and he sounded very serious. ‘This is the hard part. Stand with me in the crowd, pretend we’re just going to go forward. That’s good, just like that. Slow down, just ease up a bit. I’m going to leave in a few seconds, but don’t panic, I’ll be back – that’s it, just there, steady now, not too fast. Wait until I come back for you. Don’t shout or draw attention to yourself, just wait here for me. Good luck.’
	Adam felt the hot crush of bodies around him, the sour smell of perspiration making him feel ill. The crowd did not seem to be moving forward, and Sunny had vanished. Ahead of him there was a little girl holding a painted cage with a songbird in it. She stared at Adam with limpid eyes.
	‘They’ve closed the gangway,’ someone said.
	‘Shit, it’s the third day I’ve missed that boat.’
	‘Can you afford to bribe someone? I can’t.’
	‘Come on, let’s go. No chance today.’
	When the crowd had dispersed Adam remained on the docks with the nursing mothers and listless infants and old men and women who did not dare to venture too far from the jetty. Tomorrow there would be another boat, they said, as they watched the boat draw away, carving a smooth V in the steel-blue water behind it. It seemed to move so slowly that Adam felt he could have swum after it. He waited for Sunny for a very long time before giving up." />

She pronounced it in the Indonesian way, because he looked Indonesian, but she was not entirely certain which language she should be speaking, or indeed how she should be communicating with this boy. He had started by speaking to her in English, with more than a hint of a Dutch accent, which disconcerted her; but when he switched to Indonesian, which he did quite frequently and randomly, she found his accent impossible to place – a real problem, given that she usually adjusted her accent to that of the other person (that was another of her strengths: Mimicry and the Creation of Rapport; her Balinese accent was especially quick and fluent). ‘Just take your time – I want to know everything.’
	He began to speak, his mouth still full of ham sandwich.
	‘Please slow down,’ Margaret said. ‘You’ll be sick if you continue eating like that; in fact, it’s making me feel ill just watching you.’
	Watching him was, in fact, an unsettling but not wholly unpleasant experience. He was an interesting case study: neutral Indo-Malay features with a suggestion of Minangkabau-Malay ancestry, an essentially clear complexion darkened by the Spartan life of the south-eastern islands, which made him look at once refined and rudimentary, thus proving Margaret’s long-standing belief that the way we look – our basic features, stripped of clothing and mannerism – is affected by the conditions in which we live. It was as if a Sumatran nobleman had copulated with a tribeswoman from Irian, and this was the result. His hair was thick and slightly wavy, still damp from the shower she had insisted he take. It was shorn at the back and sides and combed over purposefully at the top with a side parting that looked like a fold in a great black sea, so precise she wanted to trace her finger along it.
	‘Please forgive me,’ he began and coughed – a stifled half-cough, almost like punctuation, an expression of politeness. ‘I am very rude. I have many things to tell you. Or, more precisely, to ask you.’
	‘Well, I’m all yours.’ Margaret tried to remain calm. She wanted to appear interested but not intrigued, to hide the sudden flush in her cheeks and the rapid tick-ticking in her chest that made her breathing quicken. His intonation, his choice of words (or, more precisely), that somewhat mannered old-world formality, the slight abruptness, the nervous cough – she had heard these words before, many years ago. She had known these unmistakeable speech patterns so well and had kept their echoes somewhere in the archives of her consciousness, like old records she thought she had lost. But here they were, clear and true, with only the slightest distortion, as if the vinyl had warped with age – or maybe it was just her; maybe she had warped with age." />

I do not know what they have done with him. This is him, I mean, he…’ he put his finger on the photograph that was on the table. ‘This one, here.’
	The photo sat squarely in the middle of the smooth green Formica surface. Adam had put it there as soon as he had come into the house, and it had remained there untouched throughout his shower and his meal. Margaret had left it alone; it lay there like an unknown, perhaps dangerous object that warranted caution, even though she knew perfectly well what it was.
	‘Here,’ Adam said, sliding the photo towards her, his index finger still fixed to the same point. ‘This is my father.’
	‘This one?’ Margaret wondered if she sounded disingenuous to him.
	‘Yes. He’s actually my foster father, which is why we, well, don’t look alike.’
	‘Yes, I had deduced that. What’s his name again?’
	‘Karl de Willigen.’ Adam looked at her with a slight frown; he seemed anxious, a touch confused. And this is you, isn’t it?’ His index finger alighted on another grainy figure, standing next to Karl. They were both dressed in sarongs; she wore a floral lace tunic, he a stiff boxy white shirt and Balinese head-dress. There were others too, Europeans, all in local costume. Margaret had never seen the photo before. It looked like a terrible fancy-dress party, she thought, embarrassing and offensive; she wished it had been a party, which would have made it less awful. A part of her wished that she had no recollection of these people or of this time of her life, but there was no escape: her perfect memory retained everything.
	‘Um-hmm, I suppose it is. The evidence is pretty unequivocal, isn’t it?’ Hearing Karl’s name pronounced in exactly the same way he would have pronounced it – with the soft ‘v’ and soft breathy ‘g’ made her head spin. She couldn’t handle that voice coming from this body. She looked at Adam and smiled. ‘It’s from a long time ago. I’ve changed so much; we all have – I’m sure Karl doesn’t look like he does here.’ She laughed a breezy laugh.
	‘Actually, my father still resembles his image in this photo. Very much so. It’s as if the years have come and gone and not changed anything.’
	‘Really?’
	‘I found this picture amongst his things.’
	‘He keeps a photo of us – I mean, old photos – on his desk?’
	‘No, it was in his boxes.’
	‘Oh.’
	‘In hunting for clues I violated his privacy, I know, but I was desperate. I found this picture and then also this one–’ He produced another photo, this time of Margaret on her own. Her hair was short, much as it was today, only curlier and messier, neatened only slightly by a single clip that pulled the curls into parting. She was sitting cross-legged, all gamine elbows and knees; her cheeks were freckled from the sun, her eyes squinting as she pulled a face. She looked impossibly young and happy.
	‘God, I look like Anne Frank,’ she said.
	Adam turned the picture over and showed her Karl’s elegant handwriting: Margaret, Ubud, December 1938. ‘So I searched some more, looked in his address books and old notebooks and diaries from his time in Bali. He mentions you quite frequently–’
	‘Really?’
	‘Yes, so I knew who you were: Margaret Bates.’
	‘What does he say about me – in the diaries, I mean?’
	‘I didn’t really read them – I wasn’t prying, you understand, I was just looking for clues. I need to find my father. Well, anyway, I digress. I memorised your name and address at the university. It has taken me nearly a whole week to reach Jakarta. Luckily I had some money, US dollars. My father had a secret hiding place in case of emergencies. He showed me where it was as soon as I got to the house. No secrets between us, he used to say. So I paid people to drive me. I bought cigarettes and liquor for lorry drivers. It was hard. I did not know if you were still alive, if you even existed. Sometimes…’ he paused and rubbed his eyes. He looked very tired all of a sudden. ‘Sometimes, when I was falling asleep on a bus or lorry, I wondered if I had just dreamt you up.’ He was playing with some breadcrumbs, rolling them between his fingers until they became tiny sticky balls. ‘I remembered quite clearly my father speaking of you. Over the years he mentioned this person, “Margaret,” and even though I was small I remember thinking that I would like to meet this American woman who had been my father’s friend.’
	Margaret reached across and patted him on his forearm, a somewhat tentative tapping with the fingers rather than a soothing squeeze. The thin bones on the back of his hand twitched and for an instant Margaret thought he was going to cry. His shoulders were hunched over, making him seem rounded, even fat.
	He continued staring at the table and shook his head. ‘I can’t explain why I have just come to you, and more particularly why I have told you all this.’
	Margaret cleared her throat; she felt an odd sensation, something she did not immediately recognise. This boy looked so lost and forlorn and alone that she wanted to reach out to him and cradle him like an infant until he fell asleep. This is crazy, she thought: surely it couldn’t be a parental urge she was experiencing. He was an adolescent Indonesian male whom she did not know. Earlier she had noticed his eyes; shiny black beads for irises, the whites unnervingly white, not tinged with jaundice like so many other local kids. Her Ability to Analyse had deserted her and she did not know what to do with him.
	‘It’s very late,’ she said at last. ‘You must get some sleep. We can talk some more tomorrow morning.’
	He nodded and then looked at her with his perfect eyes. ‘Will you help me get my father back?’
	Margaret looked down at the rolled-up bits of breadcrumb on the table and nodded. ‘I want him back too.’" />

She was fifteen, he twenty-seven. She would fall in love with him several more times over the many years that followed that initial meeting, but those occasions were less precisely recalled, blurred as they were by the various instances of falling out of love with him.
	She remembers that first falling in love without any hint of sentimentality or nostalgia. It took her more than ten minutes but less than fifteen to decide that she was in love. She knew this because she checked her watch, which she had been given for her birthday that year and which she loathed, a stupid Mickey Mouse watch, his yellow gloved hands pointing the time (why on earth had her parents chosen such a thing? Didn’t they know her at all?). She also knew that it was not a theatrical coup de foudre (the like of which she would perhaps experience later) nor indeed a surge of primitive lust, but something far more conscious and deliberate. Margaret had simply decided to fall in love. She did not tumble helplessly into schoolgirl hysterics; she experienced no shortage of breath or palpitations or any of the more vulgar symptoms often associated with falling in love. At fifteen, she was already capable of making such decisions." />

Margaret responded by waving from across the bare dirt clearing in which the dance was to take place. She continued to observe him for the duration of the event, noticing at once that he had the look of someone who had just arrived in Bali, someone struck by all the misty-eyed beauty of this fabled Eden. The symptoms were clear: the sudden serenity of expression; the inability to speak, to express oneself adequately because one did not have the vocabulary to capture what one saw or felt; the slowed-down walk that imitated the Balinese, conscious of the lack of grace in the Western posture.
	His sand-coloured hair fell across his forehead and made him look adolescent, timid and slightly lost. He sat cross-legged on the dirt, like the locals, his sarong (yes, he already had one) tucked neatly into his lap. He watched intently as the music started, piercing, discordant, eerie: notes and rhythms that could not be understood by the Western ear. There were cymbals, gongs, bells and, most of all, the heavy drumming that surged and ebbed without pause. Fantastic figures appeared, shrieking horribly, their faces shrouded by masks inhuman and terrifying. Karl did not blink, not even once. He looked helpless, as if he had stumbled into an unknown world where nothing made sense, where he was a child once more. Margaret felt a sudden surge of something she had never felt before. Analysing this feeling afterwards, she would conclude that it was a combination of many things: feelings of superiority, of experience, of wanting to be a guide, a teacher; wanting to gather something vulnerable in her arms and nurse it to health; the urge to be physically close to something warm and clear and soft. She looked at her watch: it had been ten minutes since she had first spotted him.
	The dancers, all male, clad in traditional white sarongs, began to stab at themselves with their kiris, some of them falling on the ground, writhing in pain; others bent over double, shivering, the wavy blades pressed firmly against their chests. Their muscles were strained, sinewy, their skin slick with sweat. Their eyes were wide and hollow and some of them were crying; as ritual dictated, they had slipped into a trance. The air was filled with tortured groans, an immense demonic anguish. Margaret giggled. Karl was perspiring intensely, his expression beginning to match that of the dancers, at once empty and furious, like a child recently woken from sleep. She wanted to hold him and stroke his hair and assure him that it was all a dream, a bad, cheap, silly dream that didn’t mean anything." />

Bunches of smoking coconut leaves were brought and stamped on to hasten this recuperation, and after a long time the crowd began to disperse. Bodies lay on the dirt, inert as corpses, their heads cradled in the loving arms of priests or friends. Margaret made her way over to Karl. He had managed to stand up but had not moved away. He looked dazed, surveying the carnage before him.
	‘Was that your first time?’ she said.
	‘What? Sorry?’
	‘Was that the first Barong dance you’ve witnessed?’
	Karl looked at her uncomprehendingly. ‘I think I fell into a trance too.’
	‘Oh my god.’ Margaret could not stifle a giggle. ‘That wasn’t a real trance. They know there are foreigners here. It’s never the same when there are lots of tourists.’
	‘Right, sure. But…are there lots of Westerners here? I didn’t think so. I’m not a tourist though. I was born here.’
	‘In Bali?’
	‘No. Buru. I’m sure you don’t even know where that is.’ His eyes were no longer glazed over, and he was smiling.
	‘Of course I do. It’s part of the Moluccas. Just a stone’s throw from New Guinea, the last island in the world, where I was born – on the floor of a mud hut, if you must know. I spent most of my childhood there, with the briefest of forays back to the wilderness of America, then Fiji, with a stopover in Australia, then here. You’re not going to beat me when it comes to exotic origins, so just drop it.’
	‘Oh. I see.’
	They started walking up the hill to the village. He had an easy, loose-limbed gait. ‘I left Buru when I was four. My parents went back to Holland. So I don’t really know it at all.’
	‘Can’t you remember anything?’
	‘Just fragments here and there.’
	‘I can remember everything – and I mean, everything. OK, not coming out of my mother’s womb – I can’t remember that – but I can remember things that happened to me when I was two or three.’
	He looked at her with the clearest grey-green eyes she had ever seen. He was not a tall man, she remembers thinking, almost as short as she was. ‘Mon Dieu,’ he said. ‘That’s impressive.’
	She giggled. ‘Why did you say that? In French, I mean. Couldn’t you have said, “My god”?’
	He shrugged and smiled, blushing a little (she thought). ‘I’m sorry. I lived in Paris for a number of years and things just stick in your head, I suppose. I’ve just come from there, so every time I open my mouth I’m still half speaking French.’
	‘Speech patterns do have a way of sticking to you rather quickly. What were you doing in Paris?’
	‘Studying. I was at L’Ecole des Beaux Arts. I’m an artist, a painter.’
	‘Oh god, not another one.’
	‘What do you mean?’ He stopped walking, the smile vanishing from his face.
	‘I didn’t mean anything in particular. There just seem to be an awful lot of painters here at the moment. Every other person who steps off the boat from Java seems to be an artist. They keep going on about the wonderful tropical light here, the lush vegetation, but it isn’t any different in northern Australia, so why don’t they go there? Because they want to paint bare-breasted women with doe-eyed expressions. Either that or they’re homosexual. Lots of strong willing boys to paint here. We’re very welcoming in Bali, as I’m sure you’ve heard. Which camp do you belong to?’
	He looked away and blushed (definitely, this time).
	‘Oh hell, I was just joking. Don’t take me too seriously, will you?’
	He struggled with the fold of his sarong, trying to tighten it around his waist. His shirt tails became caught up in the ugly knot he had made, which he now clutched in one fist. ‘Are there too many artists here, do you think?’
	‘No no no, I was just joking. Well, half-joking. There’s Walter, of course, and Rudolf and several others whom you will meet in due course. Really not that many. Here, let me help–’
	‘I’m fine–’ he began to protest, but Margaret reached towards him with both hands and firmly took control of the errant piece of cloth, working deftly and quickly.
	‘Anyway,’ she said, ‘I’m sure you’re better than they are. Being born in Indonesia must help. The first four years of one’s life are terribly formative – with the accent on terribly. You didn’t have an unhappy first four years, I hope. I did. But that’s another story.’ Looking down, Margaret noticed his shoes. They were slim and smooth, and she realised she had never seen an expensive pair of shoes before. She imagined them in a grand shop window on a grand avenue in Paris waiting for a delicate pair of feet to slip into them. ‘There you are, all done.’
	They stopped in front of a compound of houses. ‘Thank you,’ Karl said. ‘This is my place. I found a room here last week.’ Two old women sat in the yard, waving at them, smiling toothless smiles. Karl did not make any effort to invite Margaret to inspect and approve his lodgings, which she had expected, given that she knew about these things and he didn’t.
	‘Good. Is it nice?’
	‘Yes, I think so.’
	‘You think so? Great.’ Margaret felt momentarily irked by his smugness. How would he, having just come from Paris of all places, know if a village house in Bali was ‘nice’?
	‘Goodbye, then.’
	As I said earlier, if you want to see real trances you should come up to where we live. What you saw today was just…entertainment.’
	‘Certainly,’ he said, sounding uncertain, and began to retreat into the safety of his compound. ‘I’m very much looking forward to discovering this country’ (another little hesitation), ‘or, more precisely, to seeing you again.’ As he crossed the yard in his beautiful shoes he looked impossibly dainty and small. When he was halfway across he turned to wave at Margaret, his fine hands waving tentatively once, twice, as if he had only just learnt to bid goodbye to another person. He looked like a child, Margaret thought, just like a child." />

Margaret noted with mild dismay the fading colours on the cheap nylon. The printed peonies had been bleached from deep red to a watercolour pink and there were ugly grey lines of dirt marking the folds. Adam had unpacked the contents of his cloth bag and laid them out in a small pyramid on a chair: a pile of clothes, neatly folded; a map; a book called Diving to Adventure; a frayed old notebook, held together by a single rubber band; a few biscuits in a plastic bag, most of which had been crushed to crumbs. His BERKELEY T-shirt hung separately on the arm of the chair, as if waiting for her to take it. She looked at it for a while and then reached out for it. Maybe this was what mothers were meant to do, Margaret thought, as she felt a funny twinge in her chest.

When, finally, they did move back to the States, they did not know what to do with these bizarre contraptions. There was a Bendix in their house in Ithaca, a hulking machine with a power-wringer, but Margaret’s mother chose never to touch it; instead she employed a neighbour’s son to take their washing to the Chinese laundry from which their clothes would return some days later, immaculately pressed and folded.

They squatted beside sagging banners – CRUSH MALAYSIA, DOWN WITH WESTERN IMPERIALISTS – smoking cigarettes and chatting placidly. They wore pieces of cloth tied in bands round their heads and some of the boys were bare-chested. A few of them began to chant something, standing up and waving long thin sticks, attempting to rouse the others; but it was too hot and they were too tired, and the incipient revolt quickly died down.
	‘Very tedious, this anti-Malaysian nonsense,’ Margaret said as they drove through the gates. ‘Surely they can’t keep it up for much longer.’
	‘You underestimate Sukarno,’ Mick said. He had developed a new way of speaking that Margaret had only recently noticed, his lips held tightly together, never opening very much, as if he was gripping a cigarette between them. He had quit smoking a year ago, he said, but it was as if his lips still retained their lifelong shape. ‘This Konfrontasi thing’s become an obsession, something absolutely essential to his existence. The choice of the word is telling, I think: he wants to confront the whole world, particularly Malaysia. He really hates all that it represents – I think he actually dislikes the idea of a small neighbouring country slipping relatively painlessly into independence and becoming rich while his own country is in a mess.’
	‘So you don’t think it’s all part of his game, then? I thought it was just silliness, you know, this Asian loss of face. He’s pissed off that the Malaysians don’t want to join him in whatever he’s doing, and now he’s just using them to further his – well, whatever he does.’
	‘Oh, everything’s a game with him, but it’s beginning to feel a bit out of control. Things are accelerating, and I’m not sure he’s got a firm grip on all the bits that are whizzing round him. This Malaysia thing is pushing him further and further towards communism, and that pisses the Americans off even more. What began as just a flirtation with the Soviets and the PKI quickly became a hand-job in the back of the car, and now it’s threatening to become a full-blown marriage which I’m not sure he wants.’
	‘I hope your award-winning reports aren’t quite so imaginatively illustrated.’

	‘Yes, they look very healthy. How’s your wife?’

	‘Bill, we’ve had our differences over the years but we’ve always worked something out. I’m not the easiest of people – I’m the first to admit that – and I know I often say things that maybe I shouldn’t, but I know that you’re essentially a good guy trying to do good things.’

Let’s call it Nusa Laut, Sea Island, Island of the Sea, whatever–’
	‘–Imaginative.’
	‘Just let me get to the end. On this island – Nusa Laut – the indigenous population were made up largely of animists. There were also Christians and Muslims who moved there over the last few centuries, though neither group practised their religion in the pure sense – theirs was a religion mixed up with a hefty dose of local beliefs: spirits in the jungle, in the rocks and the streams and the sea, things that affect the everyday lives of the people who live on Nusa Laut – shall we call them the Lautese? Or the Lautians? Yes, that sounds better, doesn’t it? This curious mixture of peoples managed to find a happy way to live, and over the centuries, in the construction of ancient worship sites – temples and grottoes and shrines – and burial grounds that got swallowed up by the jungle. The locals were aware of these places, but they never thought twice about them – they were just there, part of the landscape. Then one day a geologist, an academic, comes along. Professional etiquette forbids him from taking anything from the island but he sees a fragment of a stone carving, a piece of a deity’s face – a nose, part of some lips, cheekbones – enough to convey a sense of complete peace in him. He looks around and slips it into his backpack. His local guide says nothing because it doesn’t matter to him – hey, it’s just a piece of stone, right? – and besides, he’s afraid of the white guy. The geologist takes it back to the States. He loves this rock. He doesn’t take it into the lab, he just keeps it in his study, locked away in a drawer. He takes it out and admires it from time to time. It’s beautiful, just so goddamn beautiful. That’s all it is to him: a thing of beauty. In fact, it’s the only good thing in his life. His career is going downhill, his wife left him some years back and he’s hit the bottle. One day he has a heart attack. The paramedics find him with an empty bottle of Jack Daniel’s in one hand and this piece of stone in the other. They look at it and figure, it’s old, it looks, well, archaeological, and this guy was a scientist, right? So they decide to return it to the university. It then passes through one hand to another until it ends up in an exhibition on tribal artefacts on campus. Nothing fancy, just a display of things collected over the years by the Anthropology department. Africa, South America, South-East Asia – it’s all the same to them. People come and they look without seeing, if you get what I mean – it’s all just old stuff. But one of the people who turns up is an Indonesian, OK, some kid from Jakarta on a Ford Foundation scholarship. He wanders in because he’s got nothing to do between classes and it’s cold outside, and he looks at the piece of stone and thinks, hey, that’s Lautian. Unmistakeable. Where did they get that from? It’s a rare Indonesian artefact that was looted and needs to be returned to its home country. He makes a complaint to the school, they raise it with a senator they know, he raises it with the State Department. The Indonesian guy speaks to his buddies back here about it and the next thing you know, we’ve got the Soviets making speeches to us about stealing the ancient heritage of the Lautians. And on this little island itself, there are riots because of it, they’re rounding up every Westerner they can find and shooting them for being imperialists who take advantage of Indonesia. Of course there are many Lautians who say, “This is crazy, stop this nonsense, this is none of our business, we’re being jerked around.” Guess what happens to them? They get shot by the PKI. Sukarno sends in troops to quell the communists, but no one’s sure how hard he’s trying, because he wants to be friends with the communists too, and suddenly there’s all this shit around us. Twenty years ago a stone was a thing of beauty, now it’s a political tool. So ends the tragic story of Nusa Laut.’" />

The mood had changed: the students were closer to the barricades in front of the entrance and were chanting and shouting more loudly. There were more soldiers too, standing close together with their rifles cradled against their chests. Something landed with a hollow thud on the roof of the car: a dirty canvas shoe. It rolled down the windscreen before settling on the bonnet in front of Margaret. Mick revved the engine as they inched through the crowd; people were hitting the car, slapping the windows with their bare palms, and every so often the door handles would snap noisily as someone tried to open the doors. Mick accelerated now and then, just a bit; the staccato jerking of the car would clear a space in front of them before the bodies closed in once more. Margaret looked straight ahead, avoiding the gazes of the faces pressed against the windows.
	‘Traffic’s bad today, isn’t it?’ Mick said. He sounded cheery, but Margaret easily discerned the note of anxiety in his voice. He reached for the radio and flicked it on. If you re fond of sand dunes and salty air… the voice crooned, you’re sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.
	‘These guys look as if they’re high on drugs,’ she said.
	‘The only thing they’re high on is Sukarno’s revolution. They know they want change, but they haven’t got a clue how they want to achieve it. Don’t worry, they’re just students – you’ve probably taught most of them.’
	…if you like the taste of lobster stew served by a window with an ocean view…
	They broke free from the last of the demonstrators and slipped away like a boat freeing itself from a shallow shore, escaping into deep water.
	‘What did Bill Schneider mean by ‘this time’?’ Mick asked as they joined the sea of cars and becak and trucks.
	…you’re sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod…
	‘What did he mean by what?
	‘This time. He said he wouldn’t ask you to do anything you didn’t want to – this time’.
	‘Did he? I wasn’t paying attention.’
	‘What happened last time?’
	‘I don’t have a clue.’
	‘‘It is the non-verbal communication that forms the basis of society.’ What do you think you’re communicating now?’ They had come to a halt in the traffic. A young boy, shirtless and barefoot, wearing a dirty pair of maroon shorts, pressed a newspaper against the rolled-up window and held out one hand for money.
	‘Nothing – especially since I don’t know what you’re getting at.’
	‘You’re twirling your hair and fiddling with your nose, and only just resisting the urge to bite your fingernails because you know I’ll notice it. And you are frowning as if you’re confused. I’d say you were communicating the fact that you’re lying. Doesn’t take a fucking anthropologist to work that one out.’
	‘Bill Schneider said a lot of things – I can’t recall every single detail. Besides, he’s not exactly Chekhov when it comes to choosing his words, in case you hadn’t noticed.’ She was feeling very hot; the windows were still closed, and she began to think that even the choking Jakarta air would be better than the stifling heat of the car. ‘Can we turn this godforsaken music off?’ She reached for the dashboard and fiddled with the knobs, but nothing worked.
	‘Whatever he is, he isn’t a fool. So, you worked for the CIA? How fantastic! You never told me.’
	‘Even you know how ridiculous that sounds.’
	‘Not as ridiculous as your denials. It’s obvious you were thick as thieves with Bill Schneider. Come on, what did he have you do? Was it…sexual?’
	‘One day when you’re in a less immature mood I will tell you all about my very limited involvement with Bill.’
	‘That had better be soon, otherwise you can ask him and not me to drive you around town.’
	The Jakarta sky was a murky ochre colour, a blank canvas of yellow-brown haze. If you stared at it for long enough it glowed, faintly but definitely, becoming phosphorescent like a neon bulb. From behind this curtain of smog the sun cast a light that did not seem real; everything in this city looked uncertain, imprecise…if you spend an evening you’ll want to stay watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay… Margaret continued to gaze at the sky. She rolled down the window and felt the rush of hot air against her face, and, before long, the dust and grit on her lips and tongue. She could not make out where roads merged or stopped, or where the buildings began and ended. There was only the iridescent sky above her." />

	There were no lights where they were. The city glowed faintly in the distance but they were beyond its grasp now. The car lay on the muddy track flanked by rows of bushes leading deeper into the palm oil estate. Johan reached for Bob’s outstretched hand. He could just about make out a dark square on the paler background of Bob’s palm. It was a piece of paper, but he could not tell what colour it was. He lifted it with his fingertips and put it in his mouth and then took a sip of whiskey from the hip flask he had with him.
	Thanks, Bob.
	Anytime, Brother.
	The shapes of the darkened bushes around them seemed to swell like rain clouds on a December afternoon. Now and then a car would drive by on the main road and its headlamps would sweep past, filtering through the foliage in a burst of white light before leaving them alone in the dark once more.
	Not again, for god’s sake, Farah said. You said we were going to the cinema tonight, you said we were just going to have a nice quiet evening.

	Johan shrugged. All over. Anywhere.
	Don’t lie to me. I don’t see it when I’m walking down the street. Who gives it to you?
	No one gives you anything in this town, Johan said. He held up his hand and made a twiddling motion with his thumb and forefinger. Everything has a price.
	Johan has friends everywhere, Bob said. Especially in Bangkok, don’t you, Johan?
	The brotherhood of Asian nations, that’s what it is, Johan said. There’s a new world order. Freedom to trade, it’s our right. But this, this excellent product, this comes all the way from the U S of A. He laughed and made that twiddling motion with his fingers again. Farah’s face was lit by the moon but somehow blurred. Johan blinked but could not make out the details of her features. Her skin looked powdery, almost white, clearer, brighter than ever. This light, he said, it looks like frost. He reached out to touch her chin. He needed to make sure he was not imagining it.
	Get lost, she said, and swatted his hand away. You wouldn’t know what frost looks like, you’ve never seen it.
	There was frost in England when we went last year.
	Not where we were, there wasn’t. Oh god, look at you. Your eyes. I hate it when this happens to your eyes. I feel as if I’m staring into a big black empty well.
	I’m OK. I’m OK.
	Leave him alone, Sis. Bob lay sprawled out on the back seat. He’s fine. Everything’s just fine.
	Johan, you’re in no shape to drive. What the hell is Daddy going to say if he finds out? Give me the keys.
	What are you going to do? You don’t know how to drive. Johan started up the car as he spoke and reversed slowly until they were on the main road. Don’t worry, your daddy isn’t going to find out.
	He’s your father too. And you know Mummy always wakes up early. She’ll kill you if she sees you like this. Please drive slowly, Johan, let’s go home.
	No. We’re going to the pictures. I promised you.
	They sped towards the city, streaming along the smooth roads that led sinuously into the heart of this bright new town. They glided past construction sites for the new housing estates on the outskirts, fields of mud and concrete ringed by chain-link fences. In the purple moonlight they looked like an ocean, an ocean troubled by small jagged waves carrying all manner of flotsam. Quickly, then, they were in the city. The buildings flowed past them, blurred and glittering, casting their lights upward into the sky. Sometimes, Johan thought, sometimes it doesn’t feel as if I am in the city, the city is in me." />

	Don’t look back at them, Johan, Farah said. Just don’t provoke anyone.
	Johan honked, pressing long and hard until the crowd dispersed. An old Chinese man emerged, bent-over, hurrying, and uncoiled the rope from the posts. It hung from his hands like a dead python. He waved the car into a space just outside the steps to the cinema.

He had wanted to see the sea, to find out if he was still frightened by it. So he had gone into the water late in the afternoon, when it was raining, when he was not supposed to go swimming. The raindrops were heavy and cold on his head, the sea warm, so warm, and when he put his head under water the sound of the rain falling on the surface of the sea was just like the sound of the rain on the zinc roof at the orphanage, only softer.

The radio crackled in and out of tune: Indonesian paratroopers…landings in Malaysia…skirmishes with British forces…deaths…prelude to invasion. He thought he heard the front gate creak open but there had not been a car. He went to the window and looked out; there was no one in the yard, just a black-and-white cat with a broken tail licking itself in the shade of the potted plants. There was a scattering of dead leaves across the yard, and Adam noticed that most of the plants were parched, their foliage turning crinkled and crispy at the edges. It was never like this at home (one of Adam’s more important daily chores was to ensure that the plants were well watered). He returned to his list. There was a song on the radio, a keroncong tune with its frilly strings and sweetly sung melody. It was important that he concentrate, he told himself; he needed to provide Margaret with all the information he could so that she would help him. He was seized by a sharp sense of anxiety, one that he had experienced several times over the last few days, always accompanied by visions of Karl in a squalid prison cell together with badly dressed communists who would try and steal his shoes. There would be no food and very little water, and the water would be dirty and make Karl sick. Adam closed his eyes and rubbed his temples, which had begun to ache. He made a quick mental calculation: Karl had been missing for eleven days – not quite enough time to die from starvation, but certainly enough to die from dehydration." />

	‘Hello,’ the man said, though it sounded more like a statement than a greeting. He was half-frowning but smiled, as if trying to hide displeasure. ‘Who are you?’
	Adam did not move in his chair. He rested his hands lightly on his knees, wondering what he would do if the man lunged at him. He had managed to go a whole week without being accosted on his travels, and now, when he thought he was safe, he had let down his guard and allowed a stranger into Margaret’s house.
	‘Who are you?’ Adam managed to say.
	The man did not answer immediately, but instead placed a package on the table. It was wrapped in newspaper and tied with an elastic band. ‘I’ve brought something – it was for Margaret, but I guess she’s not at home.’
	Adam stood up and backed away slightly.
	‘Don’t be afraid. My name is Din,’ the man said, unwrapping the package to reveal a comb of bananas, perfectly ripe. ‘I’m one of Margaret’s colleagues – well, I’m technically her student, but she doesn’t really supervise me. Here, have one. They’re very hard to find nowadays.’ He tore off a single plump banana and held it out to Adam.
	‘I was just passing by – I tried the telephone but the lines are down. Happens a lot these days. The exchange is always a mess, what with the troubles on the streets.’ He looked out the window as if expecting someone. ‘I hope Margaret is OK. There weren’t any classes today, everything’s been cancelled, it’s a mess. Margaret normally comes in to the campus anyway, and when she didn’t, I got worried. She still cares about her students, even though they don’t actually do any studying any more. She’s probably the only person in the world who still cares.’
	‘She seems very nice. I like her.’
	‘Are you a student too?’
	‘No,’ Adam said, taking the banana. ‘Well, not a university student, if that’s what you mean. I’m too young. I’m not sure if I’ll go to university – my father hasn’t decided yet.’
	‘That’s a shame,’ said Din, settling into an armchair facing Adam, ‘because education is the future of our country. So, who are you?’
	Adam paused to consider his questioner, a small slight man dressed neatly in a short-sleeved shirt and cotton trousers with a crease running sharply down each leg. He would not be stronger than Adam if they got into a fight, Adam thought – not unless he was armed, which he did not appear to be. ‘My name is Adam de Willigen,’ he said. ‘I am a friend of Margaret’s too.’ As he said that he blushed and felt as if he had just told a lie.
	‘What kind of name is that? You’re making it up.’
	‘No, I’m not,’ Adam said. There was something in Din’s face that irritated him: the nondescript features that took on an air of self-righteousness, the gently furrowed brow, the slim Sumatran nose – all these things suddenly became pronounced and dislikeable.
	‘Did you give yourself that name? Why do you want to be Dutch, of all things? We should be breaking free from all that. Don’t you know anything? That is why we have been fighting for the last twenty years.’
	‘They were not all bad. And anyway my name is also that of my father, and he is as Indonesian as you are.’
	Din smacked his forehead with his palm, just once, hard, and squeezed his eyes shut. Adam hoped that he had hurt himself. ‘Not another one of these self-deluding white people. I hope you don’t believe any nonsense he might have told you. It makes me so angry.’
	Adam did not reply. If it had been his house he would have asked Din to leave.
	‘OK, so you’re too young to be a university student,’ Din continued, his voice dropping to adopt a more conciliatory tone, ‘but you must have some idea of the revolution that is going on. You don’t look like a stupid uneducated boy. Listen, we Indonesians – I mean, real Indonesians – need to determine what is best for us. We have to forge a path to our destiny.’
	‘That is what my father tells me. Indonesia will decide what is best for itself
	Din lifted his chin and half-laughed, half-sneered. ‘Listen to that. You don’t even believe it yourself. It means nothing – you’re just repeating what someone told you. “Decide what is best”? It seems your whole life has been determined by someone else. Some foreigner decides what you should do – go to university or not, eat or not, pray or not. We know what is best. What is best is to live in a world that is not controlled by the West for their unjust intentions. What is best is to have a future where Asian and African countries control their own destinies. For three hundred years, someone else has written our history books for us, but now we have to re-write them.’
	‘I suppose so.’
	Din pinched his own forearm. ‘Look – we have the same skin. Same colour. I would not lie to you.’
	Adam nodded. He realised that he had never heard another native Indonesian speak at length about anything other than the tide or the waves or the drought or the rice harvest. It felt odd to hear someone who looked like him talk in the same kind of language that Karl used, only with more urgency.
	‘Your father – OK, well, he’s not your father, but I can see why you call him that – I’m sure he’s a good person. But he cannot decide your future for you. He can no longer even decide what to do for himself – all the Dutch people are being sent back to Holland. What are you going to do? Go back to Holland with him?’
	The music seemed louder, more shrill now, but Adam could not make out the words. He shrugged. ‘Yes, I suppose so.’
	And once you’re there? What will you do then? Do you think you’ll blend in, with skin this colour?’ Din reached across and pinched Adam’s arm lightly. ‘You won’t. Believe me, I’ve been there. You’ll be treated worse than a dog. Your so-called father will start to become ashamed of you, and people will say things about him, about you. You’ll have no work, and you’ll become a burden on him. You’ll be so dispirited and you will realise that you only have one place left to go: Indonesia.’
	Adam shook his head. He knew this was not true. He tried to remember the Dutch phrases he knew, the expressions he had gleaned from visitors or that Karl had breathed secretly, all those words in that forbidden, magical language.

He was completely illiterate. So was my mother – she died when I was a baby and her only wish was that I escape our village. My parents wanted a better life for me and so they sent me to school in Palembang and then to university in Jakarta. They were so happy when I won my scholarship to Leiden. They told everyone I was going to be a professor, even though they didn’t know what that meant – they just liked the sound of the word. It sounded important to them. Professor, president – these words have power over poor uneducated people. I arrived in Holland thinking I was special, that I could change things. It was raining when I arrived. I took this as a good sign – an omen of great things to come. Not even a week later, I realised that Dutch rain is not like Indonesian rain. One brings a chill to everything it touches, the other brings life. It did not stop raining in all the time I was there.

He wanted to ask a hundred questions about Holland, to ask all the questions that Karl had refused point-blank to answer – whether there were windmills and placid canals of cold clear water and plump black-and-white cows and quiet cobbled streets – but he knew that he would not get the answers from Din.
	‘Was it really terrible?’ he asked.
	‘I’ll tell you the whole story some time. Let’s just say that I realised one thing: that the only place I could call home was this’ – he gestured around him. ‘Indonesia might be a shit hole but it’s our shit hole. We will never be happy anywhere else. What’s happened to your so-called father, anyway? If he’s so wonderful, why isn’t he here to look after you?’
	‘He’s missing. They took him away – the army.’
	Din said nothing for quite some time, but stared straight at Adam, his eyes moving almost imperceptibly. On either side of Din’s mouth, Adam could discern tiny muscles twitching, just briefly, as if Din was going to smile. But he did not smile. He said, calmly but very firmly, ‘He’s abandoned you. I thought as much.’
	‘No, he hasn’t. Margaret is getting in touch with him. He’s coming back very soon.’ Adam tried to sound casual, but he knew he was not convincing. He tried to tell himself that Karl’s return was indeed imminent, but it was too much to hope for.
	‘Tell me,’ Din said, his face adopting a more serious, less confrontational expression, ‘you’re an orphan, aren’t you? Why are you expending all your energy looking for your foster father when you could look for your real family?’
	Adam shrugged. ‘I don’t know anything about my parents. They’re probably dead. They wouldn’t want me anyway – that’s why they left me in the orphanage in the first place.’
	‘Rubbish! Of course they loved you. They were just too poor to care for you.’ He leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. ‘Tell me everything you know about your family.’
	‘Honestly, I don’t know anything. I don’t want to know anything about my past. Please stop asking me.’
	‘No, I won’t stop, because it’s important. You need to know about your past. It’s who you are.’ Din’s voice softened and he smiled. ‘Look, surely you have some clue about your background. I mean, look at you. You’re clearly Sumatran, for a start – just like me! I can recognise a fellow Sumatran when I see one.’
	‘Really?’ Adam was caught off-guard by this revelation; not even Karl had been able to tell him where he was from. He stared at Din’s face and was disconcerted to find more than a passing resemblance: the skin tone, the way the eyes sat evenly on a fine-boned face. He recognised these things, and was disturbed by them.
	‘Yes, it’s clear you’re Sumatran. There’s been so much movement across the islands over the years, what with this stupid transmigration policy. Good principle, bad result. Javanese should live in Java, not in Nusa Tenggara, Sumatra should remain Sumatran, and so on. So we know your ethnic background. What else? Brothers and sisters?’
	Adam hesitated. He did not see why he should say anything to this person; but at the same time there was something about this invasive, almost repugnant man that made Adam think that he would understand everything about Johan. It was crazy, he thought, but he might know things about Johan, just as he had known things about Adam. ‘I think…’
	‘Go on,’ Din said, his voice calm and soft. ‘I’m listening.’
	‘I think I have a brother.’
	‘That’s great,’ Din encouraged. ‘You’re sure of this?’
	Adam could hear his own breaths – perfectly regular and even. He nodded. ‘Yes. I have a brother.’ This time the words did not seem so awkward – they sounded firm, comforting.
	‘You were separated when you were very young, weren’t you? That’s tragic.’
	‘Yes,’ Adam nodded. He began to feel slightly light-headed and dizzy, and wondered why.
	‘It must be difficult for you,’ Din continued speaking softly, pausing carefully as though appreciating the enormity of what Adam had just shared with him. All these years without your brother, alone.’
	Alone. Yes, thought Adam, alone.
	‘I don’t know if it helps,’ Din went on, ‘but you are not on your own in this respect. Many many young children – tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, possibly millions – have been orphaned in the last few decades, just like you. Poverty and disease and this stupid transmigration policy have created generations of orphans. If a poor family has to move to another part of the country they often leave their children behind because they don’t know what awaits them in their new home. They think they’ll come back for their kids or send for them later, but they never do.’
	As Din spoke Adam realised why he felt giddy – it was relief, of course, relief at being able to speak about Johan without feeling baffled or guilty or lost. It bothered him that Din, whom he had met only five minutes ago, should have so many insights into his life; Adam had not yet even decided if he liked Din.
	‘So what do you know about your brother?’ Din was patient and coaxing, no longer insistent as he had been earlier.
	Adam shook his head, half-expecting to be reproached.
	‘Nothing?’
	‘I get so angry that I can’t remember anything. I hate it.’
	‘Hey, hey, don’t beat yourself up. It’s not your fault.’
	A car drew up outside, its engine rattling to a halt.

	Adam nodded, though he was not quite sure why he should hide their exchange from Margaret. All he understood was that he was already complicit with Din in some way.
	Margaret paused briefly as she stepped into the house. She looked slightly perplexed to find Din, thought Adam.
	‘I didn’t know you knew where I lived,’ she said by way of greeting. ‘What brings you here?’
	‘I got your address from the registrar’s office. I rang a few times but there was no answer, so I thought I’d come over and check if you were all right. You didn’t come to the campus yesterday so I thought–’
	‘Thank you for your concern, but I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself. I see you’ve met Adam.’
	‘Yes. Well, um, I’m glad you’re OK.’
	On seeing Margaret, Adam experienced the feeling of relief and security he had felt upon meeting her for the first time the previous night. The image of the young Margaret and Karl standing together in the photograph came back to him and made him remember why he had come to this city in the first place: to regain his father. ‘Any news?’ he asked.
	She frowned and shook her head; she came towards him and put her arms round him, surprising him with a long, firm hug. It did not feel foreign or bizarre to him that she should do this; he was glad that she did. ‘No news yet, I’m afraid, but we have our contacts working on a way to find him. We will find him.’
	Din said, ‘I’d better go now. I just wanted to check that you weren’t in trouble. Nice to meet you, Adam.’ He slipped on his black canvas shoes without bothering to undo the laces. As he closed the gate behind him he gave Adam a brief nod and smiled. Adam turned away; he did not want Margaret to see that something had passed between him and Din, something that amounted to a betrayal of her trust and hospitality. He was glad that Din had gone.

	‘It’s weird, seeing you like this,’ Mick chuckled gently.
	‘Like what?’
	‘I don’t know – nervous, as if you’re not quite sure what you’re doing. I’ve never known you to be anything but in control. I’ve never seen you – hmm, how shall I put this? – so tender.’
	‘You mean I’m a cruel, heartless witch?’
	‘No, no, just…I don’t know, it’s funny.’
	‘I am nervous. We still haven’t heard any news from Bill Schneider. I don’t know if we can trust him – and besides, I’m not sure just how much he can do.’
	‘You Americans still have plenty of connections in this country, despite official relations. Let’s wait and see.’
	‘We can’t afford to wait, Mick. This boy’s future is at stake. I can’t bear the thought of him homeless, without the only family he’s ever known.’ She stood at the window and watched the rain wash thin rivulets of mud across the narrow street. The dead leaves in the front yard made a crackling noise as the raindrops hit, but otherwise all the usual noises of the neighbourhood had ceased: the barking of dogs, the howling of copulating cats, the scooters, the radio sets, the angry shouting of young men, the cry of babies. All that stopped when the rains came. It was late now; the immense city was settling down to its brief sleep.
	But Margaret was not sleepy. She could not stop thinking about the question that Adam had put to her, the one she could not answer: had she loved and been loved in return?" />

	As he felt the first warm waves of drowsiness wash through his head, he had become aware of something out of the ordinary, something that did not usually accompany his sleep. It was a smell – sweet, complex and faintly milky: Margaret’s room. Turning his head so that his nose rested against the pillow – her pillow – he’d inhaled deeply. This perfume was not very strong; it seemed to hover over the bedclothes, evaporating if he breathed in too much of it too quickly. If he tried to fix it in his senses it would disappear, but, sooner or later, it would return to him. It was a smell that seemed to have existed long before him, that was everything and everywhere, cocooning and protecting, at once a lullaby and a stimulant.
	And on this night, because of this perfume, or because of some other unfathomable reason, his dreams are clearer and sharper; and in fact they do not even feel like dreams.
	These are memories. Adam knows this even though he is asleep. These are memories of his Past Life.
	Tonight, images come to him as they sometimes do, but they do not dissolve into that terrible emptiness or flicker faintly on the edge of his sleep. They seem instead to drift like bits of flotsam that cling together to form a raft of recollections.
	He is in a room, a small square room with a concrete floor that looks smooth, almost shiny, yet he cannot feel this smoothness; his feet feel leaden and clumpy. This is why: he is wearing shoes. He does not normally wear shoes. He looks down at his feet and sees a pair of canvas plimsolls, frayed at the toes where they have been scrubbed clean with a coarse brush. The rubber soles squeak as he swings his legs. This is a sustained image, but will it lead to anything else?
	Yes. There are other people in the room – three, to be exact. One of them is a man who is wearing a white shirt with long sleeves rolled up to his elbows. There are fine golden hairs on his forearms, glinting in the light. His hair is the colour of sand, and his voice is not like that of the others. This is Karl. Karl is talking to another man, or, more precisely, he is listening while the other man speaks. This other man’s voice is calm and lilting, like the first tentative notes of a song. He is trying to persuade Karl of something. Adam understands that there is a problem. Something is not right. He understands that Karl is to take him away, but the man is saying something which Adam cannot understand. He can only hear the voice, cajoling, urging, and suddenly he begins to feel afraid.
	Through the open window he can see the silvery green leaves of a lone coconut tree, spindly and tall, jutting out from the scrubby bush. It is the only thing of colour in a landscape bleached by the drought. Yes, there is a drought. It is hot. Adam begins to feel tired, as if he is fainting, fainting into a deep sleep." />

Johan did not know what it was called, or who the singer was, he just recognised bits of the chorus. It was something like cant get used to lovin you, or losin you, he was not sure which. There was a young Chinese couple in the lift with them. The woman knew all the words but the man only knew the last bit. He sang it out of tune, in a voice like a child’s, and she giggled. You-oo. You-oo. Her hair was thick and glossy and set in an arc that came down one side of her face, ending in a curled tip. Her lashes were heavy and her eyes outlined in black. Johan thought, She wants to look like Chan Po-Chee or some other Hong Kong singer. She was laughing gaily and looking up at the ceiling of the lift as if she was looking at the sky, as if there was no roof above them and she could see the moon, or perhaps flocks of birds flying across the night sky.

He had crept out of their beach-side chalet and walked into the warm clear water and swum over the fields of coral which, in the moonlight, looked like a shadowy map of an unknown world where the boundaries were uncertain and the countries kept changing shape. And when he went deeper still, beyond the shallows where the water was black, he had seen clusters of fluorescent light, and he had thought maybe these were pearls or sea-creatures, or maybe it was light from the sky, refracted in funny ways. When he came back, Farah was waiting for him, sitting on the sand with her legs crossed.

I ask Farah and she says, Oh, Mummy don’t worrylah, we just go to the movies, relax at the hawker stalls with our friends. Relax, my foot. I know you don’t just drink teh-tarik when you go out. Every time I see my friends I’m worried they’re going to say something about you, especially that Mrs Teo, she loves saying things like, Wah, I hear your boy Johan is very popular with the girls, huh? I can’t stand that. Oh Johan, what am I going to do? You were always such a good boy.
	Beneath them the city seemed to be moving, slowly, the lights blinking, the shadows shifting. Johan felt tired and slightly ill. He needed to move. He needed to be in a car, going fast, not sitting here at this table.
	And besides, Johan, kids are getting into trouble every night, good children from good families, not just naughty boys from Selayang. The FRU are beating people up left, right and centre just because they feel like it. After dark they treat everyone the same, whether you’re a gangster or a normal teenager. Can you imagine the shame if…if something happened to you? Daddy’s position would be…oh I don’t even want to think about it.
	I won’t get into trouble. I promise. Don’t worry, Mummy.
	Oh baby, Mummy’s not saying you do anything naughty, I’m just saying be careful, that’s all. Now, what looks good? This place is brand new, just opened. For two weeks I’ve been saying to your daddy, Please can you take me to that new place. But he says no, too expensive. Ridiculous! Look how he spends on other things. Just order anything you want. We’re going to have a nice time. Australian beefsteak for you? Shall I have Lobster Thermidor?
	Anything, please order for me.
	Look, look! Can you see? The restaurant really is revolving!
	Yes, Mummy, I can feel it. It was a lie. He could not feel it moving.
	Wow, look at the view, Johan. When Daddy and I moved here just after the War there was nothing here – nothing! Now look at it. Just in the last ten years, my god what a change. When you were a little boy this was just a big kampung, can you remember?" />

He cut into the meat carefully and watched the knife slicing slowly through the bloodless flesh. He dabbed at his mouth with the corners of his napkin now and then, and poured some iced water into his mother’s glass.
	It’s so nice to be out to dinner with you. Sometimes Mummy just needs to show you how much she loves you. You’ve always been my special one. My perfect son.
	You’ve got Bob too.
	Yes, Bob, of course. But Bob came after you. You were my baby, just mine. Anyway, I don’t know why Daddy started calling him Bob when he was a baby. Darling, I said, we call Johan Johan and Farah Farah, why do we call Hisham Bob? But he just, well, you know what he’s like. Sometimes you know when not to argue.
	He loves Bob. Bob’s his real son – he looks just like him.
	Don’t say that, darling. Daddy loves you too.
	You know he doesn’t. Don’t pretend he does. He hates me. He hates even looking at me.
	It hurts me to hear you talk like that. I wish you weren’t so angry with your daddy and me all the time. Take it back.
	Why did you adopt me?
	Oh, darling, we promised we would never talk about that again. Why do we always have to go over the past? All that history, it’s another world, baby, it doesn’t exist any more. Why do you keep bringing it up?
	I like hearing about it. Don’t know why. I keep thinking, maybe one day you’ll tell me something different. Sorry, Mummy, I’m not angry with you. Please tell me, it makes me feel better.
	You know I couldn’t have babies for a long time. We tried so hard, and all Daddy’s family were saying, when is Salmah going to have a baby? When is Salmah going to have a baby? as if it was my fault. That’s when we went to Indonesia. We have to go somewhere far far away, Daddy said, I don’t know why. Daddy didn’t speak to me for the whole journey there. There, I never told you that before. But when I saw you, I knew. I knew I found my baby, my very own son.
	OK, I’m sorry I asked. Don’t cry, Mummy. I don’t want you to be unhappy.
	The restaurant did not seem to be revolving at all. Johan looked out of the window and saw that nothing had changed. The patches of light were no longer moving. Johan looked at the silhouette of the hills in the distance, the rise and fall of the slopes, and thought maybe if he stared long and hard he would see them move sinuously, like the dragon-shaped lanterns the Chinese kids would hang during the Autumn Festival; they would light candles and place them in the hollowed-out dragon bellies so that they flickered and shifted and cast funny silken shadows on the walls. But he knew the hills and the city would not move, no matter how hard he tried.
	Mummy, he said in a softer voice, will you tell me again about my brother?
	No, please, Johan, I can’t stand talking about that. Oh my god. She wiped her eyes with a thin handkerchief. It makes me feel sick remembering how – oh – how he…It makes me sick…lucky you didn’t see. Anyway, Bob is your brother, your only brother. Don’t you forget that, darling.
	OK. I’m sorry, Mummy.
	I don’t think I can finish my food now. It’s too much for me.
	Are you sure, Mummy? It looks very good. Mine is delicious.
	No. Anyway I have to look after my figure.
	I’m sorry, Mummy. I won’t ask you about all that stuff again. Promise.
	Across the room the Chinese couple who had been in the lift were reaching out to each other, fingertip brushing against fingertip, barely touching, just seeking reassurance that the other person was there, wanting to know that they could grab hold of each other and never let go if the restaurant started to spin out of control. Johan wished that the room would revolve faster and faster. He wanted to see what the couple would do, because he knew that they would not remain together.
	I’m just going to the ladies’ room to freshen up, then we should go, darling. I’m tired all of a sudden, I don’t know why. I feel so hot, oh, I think it’s age. My son is nearly a man now, what do I expect? I must be an old woman! Give me five minutes, then, home." />

She was wearing a slim-fitting flowery blouse with a cheongsam collar and very short sleeves that showed off her arm, her still-extended arm that lay flat on the table from elbow to fingertip. They were getting ready to leave, heading back out into the night, and Johan felt calm because he knew that soon, he too would be driving through this city.
	The lift doors opened and a man and a woman stepped out. Their faces were obscured by a bouquet of orchids on the bar, but Johan could see that their arms were linked, elbow locked comfortably into elbow, and he could hear the waiters’ voices, servile and nervous and twittering, and he could discern the colour and tone of a young woman’s taut calf, the slenderness of her hips contrasting with the stoutness of her middle-aged partner as they were shown to a table at the far end of the restaurant, hidden in a niche perfectly made for secret lovers.
	Johan got up and went to the shiny marble desk at the front of the restaurant. Please take my bill to my father, he said. He’s over at that table there. Yes, Dato’ Zainuddin. Just tell him it’s from his son. Johan, yes. He will settle the bill for me.
	In this new, rich city, Johan thought, people’s lives were like currents out in the open sea, pulling them to places they could not resist. It was no use swimming, you just had to surrender to the waves and see where they took you. A long time ago, when he was small, he’d imagined himself borne away by the sea. He wanted to be dragged away by the waves which would leave no trace of him. If he had done so, his brother would be in this expensive restaurant, the perfect happy son for mummy and daddy. But Johan had not dared, and so he was still here.
	Come on, Mummy, let’s go. I’ve taken care of everything. Please don’t say that, it’s nothing, really, it’s nothing. You give me so much pocket money anyway. Take my arm, careful, the doors are closing. Look at the time, it’s late. Don’t worry, I’ll drive carefully." />

For a very brief moment she remembered all the things he had said to her when she first met him, many years ago. He had been very direct, and she very gullible. It was a time she did not care to remember, but she could not stop remembering. She said ‘yes’ and ‘mm’ several times, then she hung up. All in all, it was not a very long conversation." />

He had not moved from his reclining position; his eyes were still closed. His body was too wide for the modest Asian sofa and he had to lean slightly on his side, pushed up against the cushions in what looked like an extremely uncomfortable position. ‘You sounded very shifty indeed.’
	‘Not at all,’ Margaret said, sitting down. ‘I was just trying not to wake anyone up.’ She realised that she, too, had fallen into a too-deep sleep in the armchair, waking up with the crick in her neck that brought with it nagging aches and pains. She thought of some of the places she had slept: on the bare boards of a Dayak longhouse, listening to the snuffling of pigs under the house; on the mud floor of a Sepik dwelling; on the back of a truck travelling towards Bromo, propped up against sacks of rice, surrounded by cages of defecating chickens. She had managed to sleep quite happily then, and she had never woken up with a bad back or a stiff neck or a cramped arm as she did so often these days. She could not remember ever waking up from a night in a jungle lean-to feeling out of sorts, plagued by a mild sense of dread, wondering how she would fill the day ahead of her. The days seemed to take care of themselves back then; the hours went by and there was never enough time to do all she wanted. Now there was only time, and time created space – and nothing could occupy the space that it created.
	‘Do you ever wake up afraid of what the day has in store for you, Mick?’ she asked.	
	‘Usually I have a bad hangover and all I want to do is find an aspirin. Or another drink. So, no, I’m not afraid, just desperate to clear my head. But don’t try and change the subject. What did Schneider say?’
	‘Shh.’ Margaret lifted a finger to her lips. ‘You’ll wake Adam.’ Night was turning quickly into dawn but in those twilight moments there was still a heavy calm, troubled only by the bored half-hearted yap of a dog in the distance. ‘Bill thinks Karl is being repatriated. It seems he got picked up in an army raid on communists. They weren’t expecting to find a Dutch guy, he just got trawled up in the net – you know, like some prehistoric fish that everyone thought was extinct but gets hauled up with a big catch of sardines. Sheer accident that they got hold of him – he was so far off the radar that he would have got away, but it seems nowhere is out of reach these days, Mick. The army has its tentacles everywhere.’
	More dogs were barking now, calling idly to each other across the rubbish heaps that littered the streets. The air smelled fresh and moist, but in a few hours it would be hot and dusty again, and the memory of last night’s rain would evaporate into the ochre sky. ‘It seems that Karl is still here, in Indonesia. At first they kept him with the farmer-fisherman communists from the islands. You know what they’re like, they’re rednecks. They panic at the sight of a white guy – either they try and marry their daughter off to him or they lock him up. Then he got moved to Surabaya, then the trail begins to go fuzzy. There have been one or two repatriation flights from East Java, but Bill can’t find any trace of him on those lists. He thinks Karl is here in Jakarta, waiting to be flown back to Holland. Bill’s contacts are trying to find out more, but it’s not easy. US dollars can’t buy everything nowadays and besides, no one’s really interested. There are bigger things on the horizon. Even Bill says so. He was honest about our chances of finding Karl. There’s big trouble not far away, he says. You were right, Mick. Something terrible is about to happen.’
	‘It’s the communists, isn’t it? They’re falling out of favour and Sukarno doesn’t know if he should get in bed with them or chop their balls off
	‘That’s what Bill says. The Soviets and the Chinese are pumping money into Indonesia and no one knows where it’s going, or what they’re doing. The army’s getting very nervous about the whole thing – they don’t know what’s going to happen.’
	‘No one knows anything any more.’
	Margaret watched Mick reach for his long-empty bottle of beer and scratch at the last remnants of the label with his fingernail. ‘I just cannot accept that there is a white guy wandering around Java and we can’t find him,’ she said. ‘No, I will not accept it.’
	‘You’re on a losing wicket, darling. This is a country of more than a hundred million people. Why should any Indonesian care about some solitary white guy who’s gone AWOL when they’re dying of hunger, and on the brink of a civil war? The Dutch are ancient history in this country, can’t you see? Even if your guy is in Jakarta – and there’s no guarantee he is – we still need to find him in the biggest, dirtiest, most wretched and corrupt city in the world. There is no chance.’
	‘That’s always been your problem,’ Margaret said, raising her voice. She felt curiously energetic; the stiffness in her neck had ceased to bother her and she was no longer feeling lethargic. ‘You’ve always just accepted the way things are, you just go with the flow. Ever since I’ve known you, that’s been the way you are. It’s so damn frustrating. What is it you used to say to me when we first met? “L’action c’est pas la vie, so why bother?” – or some bullshit like that.’
	‘Actually it was “L’action nest pas la vie, mais une façon de gâcher quelque chose, un énervement.” It’s from Rimbaud.’
	‘Whatever. That’s why you’re still a third-rate hack, stringing for the mediocre newspapers of the world. You have a brilliant mind and you’re in one of the hottest political climates in the world – and still you refuse to get your act together. We can find Karl. It can’t be that difficult. Come on. You’ve got scores of contacts in Jakarta. Ring your journalist friends. I’ll speak to people I know, I’ll sniff around – I have a nose for these things. We’ll find him. Don’t be so defeatist. And will you stop picking at that bottle, please?’
	‘You haven’t told me why this Karl de Willigen is so important to you. I presume he’s the long-lost love you never confessed to having had.’
	Margaret looked him squarely in the eye and contemplated telling him the whole truth: how she sometimes woke up in the night and remembered exactly the way Karl looked in the half-light of a Balinese dusk; how she remembered being sixteen and in love, knowing that she would be clinging to her memories a quarter of a century later. She said, ‘It’s complicated, Mick. We were very close friends. He must have represented something to me, though I’ve never figured out what, exactly. But do you really think I’m the sort of woman who pines after a man? Get a grip on yourself, Mick Matsoukis. I’m doing it for the boy. I want him to get his father back. Don’t you?’
	‘Speaking of which, what are we going to do with the boy?’
	Margaret paused before replying. Her initial instinct was to keep Adam by her side every moment of the day. She had not felt at ease, leaving him on his own at home. He was too vulnerable, too helpless. But the thought of losing him was even more frightening. ‘He stays here,’ she said, dropping her voice. ‘It’s too dangerous having him with us – maybe I’ll call Din and ask him to look after the kid. Let’s just get through today and see how we get on.’
	Daybreak over Jakarta was swift and uneventful, the darkness of the night sky replaced decisively by its murky daytime haze; non-colour substituted non-colour in a quick, perfunctory sweep. There was no ceremony, no lingering moment of aching beauty during which one might reflect on life and love, or yearn for things lost, or things as yet unrealised. The change was ruthless and efficient and unsentimental – typically Asian, thought Margaret. She liked it that way. She was no longer a prisoner of the night and all its limitations. In the intense days of this city she could accomplish anything she set out to do.
	‘I’ll check in with you later this afternoon,’ she said, starting to make herself a cup of coffee. ‘And remember, Mick: this is your big chance too. The mother of all stories is just round the corner, and it’s got your name written all over it.’" />

She had seen thirteen Independence Day celebrations, each one grander and more lavish than its predecessor, marked by the construction of a grandiose ‘gift’ to the nation, some useless futuristic monument or stadium or theme park. She had become inured to it all, familiar with the grotesque. She remembered – with no sense of regret, just a tinge of sorrow – how those first Independence Days had seemed so exciting, so full of promise. She was newly arrived from Europe and her whole life was waiting to be rebuilt, much like this new country with its young President. She had been ready for change, ready for the task ahead of her, and so had they. She looked around this city now: they had lost their way, but she would not allow herself to be dragged away with it.
	She tried to remember how she’d felt back then – not just how she or the city had looked, but the optimism she had felt. The physical scenes were easy enough to recall. The streets were muddy and barely covered with tarmac; even the centre of the city seemed to be filled with kampungs that ran indistinctly into each other, clustered on the edge of the black canal where people washed and lived their entire lives. There was the smell of drains and sewage (that hadn’t changed) but also the odour of camphor, she remembered, a woody, heady smell that made her feel good, even healthy, like some mysterious fortifying medicine that was everywhere in the air; all she had to do was breathe. What was more difficult to recapture now was that well of strength, that sensation that no hurt or sadness or damage of any kind could not be put right. Nothing was beyond repair, everything was achievable. It wasn’t that long ago, goddammit, so why didn’t it just instantly come back to her? Everything she looked at had seemed full of promise, even Bill Schneider." />

	‘There was a time when it didn’t. I remember it very well, you know.’ He smoothed his thinning hair across his head, even though not a wisp of it was out of place. He had not lost any hair in the years that Margaret had known him; he had always looked like this – an overgrown schoolboy forced into a man’s body, someone who had learnt the gestures of adulthood long before his time without truly understanding what those gestures meant. And now that he was an adult, it was too late to recapture the innocence of his youth. It seemed that only Margaret had ever seen this part of him. She had latched on to that tiny bit of goodness, she thought, and had wanted to make it her own." />

At first she had thought that it was a reflex action triggered by nervousness, but once she had spoken to him a few times she knew that he was not a boy who had ever been nervous. Maybe it was about control, she thought, though she wasn’t sure. He’d asked her out. They’d driven along the banks of Seneca Lake and shared an ice-cream sundae in Geneva.

	‘I’m sorry, Bill, I don’t know if I can give you what you want.’
	‘Of course you can, sweetheart, I’m not asking for much. You’ve done it before.’ He leaned across the table and touched her forearm. She expected his hand to be clammy but it was dry and smooth, as it had been twenty years ago.
	‘It’s different now,’ she said, ‘the students don’t trust me any more. They don’t respect me.’
	‘That’s not the Margaret I know. I hope you’re not being deliberately unhelpful.’
	‘Honestly, Bill. I just – I just don’t have my finger on the pulse any more.’
	‘Look, Margaret,’ he said, sweeping his hand across his forehead again. His voice changed suddenly, becoming calmer, less cajoling. His fingers began to feel curiously heavy on her arm. ‘I need names. Commies. That university is a hotbed of activism. I just need to know who the ringleaders are, what they’re planning. You have an ear to the ground. We have these kids just out of grad school sitting in offices analysing political trends, trying to tell us how the next few months are going to turn out, but it doesn’t count for anything. I have one guy, fluent in standard Indonesian and old-fashioned Javanese, PhD in linguistics, picking apart all of Sukarno’s speeches from the last ten years, looking for clues as to how this guy is thinking, what he’s going to do next – and you know what? We still don’t have a clue. You remember that outburst six months ago, when Dean Rusk announced there was to be no more aid to Indonesia? In every newspaper in the world Sukarno screamed, To hell with your aid. This kid wrote a twenty-page report on that one line. Conclusion? Sukarno doesn’t want US aid. Jesus. But you know, Margaret. You hear things. You’re one of us, but it’s like you’re one of them too. How about your colleagues? I hear your research assistant has an interesting background.’
	‘Din? You’re crazy.’
	‘I have information, Margaret – intelligence. Something is being planned on that campus, something big. I need to know what it is, and whether it’ll harm our interests.’
	‘Our interests? What does that mean? For years I reported on the students to you because I thought you wanted to help, because you were new here and you needed information to help this country to help itself. That’s what you said. God, I was stupid. If we hadn’t been…oh, forget it. This is crazy. What sort of intelligence do you have on Din? I just cannot believe he is a danger to anyone.’
	‘I can’t tell you that, Margaret, but you have to trust me. Please. Just give me whatever you can find out. You might think I’m exaggerating, but your country needs your help. Your people need you. The world’s gone crazy and America needs all the help it can get so that it can help others. And don’t forget that I’m doing all I can to find your friend.’
	Margaret did not say anything. A number of witty, cutting responses began to form in her head but faded away quickly. There was really nothing left for her to say.
	Bill’s hand was still on her arm. ‘Call me tomorrow,’ he said suddenly, as if some bright memory had re-entered his thoughts after a long absence; his fingers tightened slightly around her wrist, pleading rather than threatening. ‘It’s Sukarno’s big twirl before the cameras of the world. This year’s Independence Day speech is going to be something else. The temperature’s going to be raised quite a few degrees. Let’s listen to it together. I think I can get access to the Presidential Palace – a friend will fix it for us. Please say yes – it’ll remind me of my first days here, running around town with you. You’ll see all your old contacts, and you never know who might help you.’
	Just say no, Margaret thought. She paused. The breathless excitement in Bill’s voice was not genuine, she told herself; he doesn’t care about you, or about the past, or even about himself. This man is an actor, a fake; it’s part of his job.
	‘OK,’ she said. ‘I’ll come.’" />
	<TS ID="TS178" SPANS="284563~288819" ACTORS="A1,A13,A108,A109" LOCATION="L1" NAME="Din talks with Adam about the poet known as Hanawi" TYPE="Fiction" PER="A0,A13,A1" TEXT="14 The poet known as Hanawi, who celebrated the lives of the fishermen and subsistence farmers of Perdo and its neighbouring islands, remained unknown during his tragically short lifetime, despite a prodigious literary output over a career that lasted a mere decade before he drowned aged just thirty-two. He had taken his little outrigger far out to sea, its gaily painted hull braving the swell of the powerful waves that morning, according to the fragments of hearsay and eyewitness accounts that have since crystallised and become quasi-history He knew these waters well (which schoolboy can forget the immortal lines ‘And thus the sea is my country/ It is my land, my sky/Indeed, it is my blood’?), but that day the skies were exceptionally dark with cloud and everyone knew a bad storm was about to break over Perdo. Most of the other fishing boats came back early, but Hanawi’s did not. The storm lasted two days, and when the waters had calmed the fishermen found his boat washed up on the rocks that circled the western end of the coral reef. Its frail mast had been broken but the sail was curiously intact, floating in the clear green water. After the storm, the sea was glass-like and flat once more; it was hard to imagine that there had been a storm. It is like this in Perdo, as you know: the changes are so absolute, so extreme that you can never believe anything else exists before or after the very moment in which you find yourself.
	The manner of his death no doubt contributed to the image of the romantic poet who lived the authentic life of the masses. In language of extraordinary simplicity, he captured the harshness and beauty of rural life. His verse was free from the conventions of court poetry with its formality and associations with nobility: his voice embodied a sense of freedom and pride that echoed the lives of poor villagers, a sense of liberation and identity that has taken on greater importance in recent times, even (or perhaps particularly) in the cities. Take these lines from his celebrated poem ‘Hartini’, for example:
	When seas are dark, anxious, the quick swell of each wave
	lifts the boat quite some way, as light as an arrow.
	When you fly, all your tears – yes, tears – are for now, save
	the few which may, just may, be shed for tomorrow.
	When the catch is bounteous, on those rare fine bright days,
	the mackerel seem to play, spinning a small rainbow.
	You notice her eyes: fierce, yet lost, too, in a haze.
	Come back, you want to say. Come back from your sorrow.
	Can you hear that it is a double pantun? Hanawi uses this traditional everyday form in new and playful ways, tweaking it, making it seem casual and more modern – but none of this is really relevant. What is important is that even illiterate villagers can relate to the rhythms of this style. We grew up with it, our ears are tuned to it. And so, in a funny way, it means something to us all. We feel what it is to be one people, free in our own country.
	Does it matter, then, to find out that Hanawi was not, in fact, born on one of these remote islands but into a prosperous family of Chinese immigrants in Malang? He did not grow up speaking the coarse dialect of Perdo with its dull vowels and over-emphasised consonants, but Javanese of a very stately variety, in addition to what was to become standard Indonesian and, of course, Dutch, educated as he was at the Hoogere Inland School. At home his family spoke Teochew, the language of his forefathers who had emigrated from southern China midway through the nineteenth century. It is true that he shunned the trappings of sophisticated Javanese life in favour of a simple existence in the islands, but he was able to do so due to the wealth and generosity of his family. He wrote ode after ode to the lives of fishermen but did not himself work as one; in fact, he never worked at all. Do you think this affects the authenticity of his voice? Does this change the way we read his work? When political leaders quote lines of his to show how in touch they are with the lives of ordinary folk, should we be moved, or simply howl with derision?

His eyes felt ill-equipped to deal with the city; it was very different from the one he had imagined. A dog trotted past, and Adam saw that it had something embedded in its hindquarters, a bit of shrapnel; the flesh and skin had grown back over it, covering it with a lump of tissue so that only the tip of it poked out.

	‘You can’t stay in all day, can you? Don’t you want to see a bit of Jakarta? Come on, let’s go and discover things. I’ll be your tour guide. Don’t you trust a fellow Sumatran?’

You were abandoned and left to fend for yourself without any understanding of the world around you.’
	‘That’s not true,’ Adam said. ‘I am educated. My father taught me everything – literature, music, even politics.’
	Din curled his hand into a fist and punched his own forehead, hard enough to make a dull thudding noise. He closed his eyes, and Adam thought maybe he had hurt himself. A self-deluding orphan, I see. Right, tell me all about the conference that took place in ’55, right here in Indonesia. Don’t know? I’ll give you a clue. It happened in Bandung. No? I’ll tell you: the Conference of Newly Independent Asian and African Countries, hosted by the President. The start of the new world order, which we control. What about the Non-aligned Movement. No? Do you see what I mean?’
	Adam did not quite see what Din meant, and it frustrated him that he could not fully grasp what Din was talking about. It also disturbed him that Din had all this knowledge that he himself lacked. Part of him did not believe that it was all true. He thought he knew about Bandung. It was an elegant city in the hills where the air was cool, a place people fled to, hoping to escape the heat of Jakarta and stroll along elegant boulevards lined with noble old buildings. He decided he would not say any of this to Din. Compared to what Din knew, all his learning suddenly felt insubstantial and flimsy – a child’s view of the world. The years of learning from and listening to Karl had not amounted to anything. He felt like an infant in the glare of Din’s brilliance.
	‘You see the world through a European’s eyes,’ Din continued before Adam had a chance to respond. ‘Your own eyes do not work. You can’t see how the world is changing around you. That little country just to the north of here, our neighbour – what’s that called?’
	Adam knew the answer. He had come across it in the papers and on the radio. ‘Malaysia,’ he said, trying to sound casual, not too pleased with himself.
	‘You see? How predictable.’
	‘But it’s there,’ Adam said, pointing ahead of him, as if Kuala Lumpur lay just beyond the horizon. ‘It exists, doesn’t it?’
	‘No! That is the point – Malaysia does not exist!’ Din shouted suddenly, his head jerking. ‘Malaysia’ – he pronounced it as if speaking a foreign language, his voice squeaky, like a child’s, and Adam remembered the children’s voices at school, mocking his surname: De Willigen? De Willigen? and he remembered the hurt and the shame he’d felt, the shame for something that was not his fault – ‘Ma-lay-sia is a British construct! It is a work of pure fiction, created by the old Imperialist countries to destabilise Indonesia and all the newly independent countries of the world. It was created so that Britain and America and their cronies can continue to have a presence in this region, but I tell you, their time is finished, finished! We will invade them and crush them, all those Malaysian puppets. They look like us and even speak our language – but they do not know they are being used. This is why we beat them in the Thomas Cup: they are not masters of their own destiny. We are.’
	Din fell silent for a moment, his chest heaving with an exhausted satisfaction. In that instant the roar of the Jakarta traffic took over, seizing the initiative from Din’s monologue to fill Adam’s ears with its own rhythms. And yet Adam knew that Din would not, indeed could not, stay silent for long. ‘My brother,’ he said, ‘is in Malaysia.’
	‘What?’ Din said, turning to look at him. ‘I thought you didn’t know where he was.’
	Adam shrugged. ‘I don’t know anything for certain.’
	‘Oh god, this gets worse. Not only do you think like a white person, you have a brother who lives in a neo-imperialist country. This becak driver must be lame. Why is he so damn slow? The speech will be starting soon. We’re going to listen to it with some of my friends. You’ll learn things. It will be good for you.’" />

They were on the edge of a sprawling shantytown bordering Kebon Jeruk, where the houses still seemed solid and at least semipermanent, built more from timber than pieces of rusty corrugated iron: they would at least weather this rainy season, and maybe also the next one. Deeper in this labyrinth, away from tarmac roads and running water, the houses were a patchwork of salvaged scrap: flattened oil drums, biscuit tins, fragments of tarpaulin, splintered lengths of wood, torn mosquito nets – anything that would bring momentary respite from the rain and the sun. But even here, on the fringes of the kampung, Adam had seen a tiny house with walls made from bits of advertising boards. In front of this house a young woman was fanning a wood-fire that refused to light properly. Next to her there was a child, a girl, no more than three or four years old, naked except for a dirty ribbon in her hair; she looked up at Adam as he walked past and retreated shyly into the shade of the house. There was no front door, just a gap in the walls that read
	…KES YOU TEN TIMES STRON…MOUS ALL OVER THE WORLD, NOW AVAI…
	‘Of course these houses will not last very long,’ Din shrugged, ‘but they can be quickly rebuilt. We are strong, practical people, remember,’ he said.
	They came upon a circle of men and women not much older than Adam; Din had explained that they were all students at UI. ‘This is the orphan I told you about,’ Din announced casually to his friends, as if he had simply said ‘Sundanese’ or ‘Torajan’. Adam felt angry with himself because he did not have the courage to explain and modify this description to a group of strangers (he did have a father, after all). But then again, maybe Karl was dead, and now he was an orphan twice over.
	‘Your orphan doesn’t look very happy,’ one girl said. She was about Adam’s age, perhaps slightly older, and spoke in a voice similar to Din’s – steeped in a confidence that suggested formal education, with proper articulation tempered by a casual Jakarta accent. Their sharp, clever voices were a code, thought Adam, a method of conspiracy; he did not belong with these people. And yet this girl was not exactly like Din. She had a relaxed quality, a self-assuredness that ran deeper than mere education. It came from something else, something that Adam thought he could recognise: privilege, that sense of being special. He didn’t know if he could even call her a girl. She looked his age, but everything about her – her poise, her stylish hair (short and falling in soft curves on either side of her face, like a movie star’s, unlike the severe and functional hairdos of the other girls present), her easy vowels, the way she sat, legs crossed, one elbow propped on the table – made her seem a proper grown-up woman.
	‘Orphans never are,’ someone else added, and suddenly everyone was speaking.
	‘How can they be?’
	‘It’s impossible to find true happiness if you’re an orphan.’
	‘That’s not true. Orphans are the only ones who are free to find their own happiness; they don’t have their own history so they create it for themselves.’
	‘But Z, that’s just an illusion. Their lives are determined for them by people who have no relation to them whatsoever – total strangers dictate their future. They have no attachment to anything, they stumble about in the dark until one day something happens to set them on a different, random path. I don’t call that freedom.’
	‘But that’s just what it’s like for all of us!’
	There was laughter, either cold and scoffing or shrill and juvenile.
	‘We run a revolutionary magazine called Z,’ said the girl with the stylish hair. Her name was Zubaidah, she explained, but she was known only as Zu, or even just Z. ‘I hate my full name. It’s too…pretty. When we started the magazine it needed a name, something that was not crass and obvious like the other dull dogmatic pamphlets you see – Revolusi, Time For Change, The People’s Voice and so on. It’s not easy to come up with a name for an underground literary newspaper, you know, so we just named it after me, just to give us something to get started.’
	‘But then I had a brainwave,’ a youth of perfect complexion said. He had long hair that hung in fine strands almost to his shoulders; he was trying to grow a beard, but he’d managed only a meagre moustache and a straggly goatee. ‘ “Z!” I said – the last letter of the alphabet, ignored, mysterious, underutilised. Perfect!’
	‘Awie is the poet amongst us, you see,’ said Z.
	‘In fact, Z stands alone at the end of the alphabet, lonely, without any prospects in life, abandoned by all the others. It is the orphan of the alphabet – it should appeal to you.’
	He slid a flimsy, shoddily bound magazine across the table towards Adam. ‘Our latest issue.’
	Adam flicked through it, pausing occasionally, pretending to read; he nodded, feigning comprehension and appreciation. The dense text was punctuated by several cartoon drawings. There was one of the President in bed with a busty European woman, their huge feet protruding from the tangle of sheets, toothy grins etched across their faces. It was set next to another drawing, of the President gnawing on a gargantuan chicken drumstick in a field of wilting rice; in the background a farmer surveyed the cracked mud, his shoulders hunched. The caption under both drawings read: OUR HERO." />

He had not lost his frown, which seemed, if anything, to have deepened, creating little crevasses across his forehead. He glared at Adam and jabbed his index finger in the direction of the radio that sat on a chair, all on its own in the middle of the group. They all shuffled their chairs towards it, leaning forward, elbows resting on knees, chins cradled in palms, ready to fall deep into concentration. Adam copied their movements; he remembered the tales of ancient philosophers that Karl had told him about and felt as if he were a pupil or scribe at the feet of some electronic preacher. There was a moment of near-complete silence; they could not hear even the faintest crackle of static from the radio. In the distance there was a baby’s cry, a thin wail that started and then stopped; there was no other noise from the slums around them. Adam wondered if the radio had failed at the crucial moment. He held his breath, listening. No one moved. And then the voice began speaking in a tone at once urgent and measured. He had never heard a voice like this before: rich with calm strength and intonations that seemed both foreign and familiar. He felt a hot surge running through his body, filling his head with a sudden, giddy excitement he could not explain." />

Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man is corroded and made bitter by fear – fear of the future, of the hydrogen bomb, of ideologies, of everything, but especially of the loss of mans safety and morality. Perhaps this fear is a greater danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which drives men to act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly…’
	‘Just get to the point,’ Din muttered. A sharp chorus of tutting and shushing started and died down with equal swiftness, and once again the voice on the radio was the only sound to be heard.
	‘…nowadays to hear people say, “Colonialism is dead”. Let us not be soothed or deceived by this. I say to you, friends and fellow revolutionaries, that colonialism is NOT dead. How can it be, so long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are not yet free? I beg of you not to think of colonialism only in the classic form which we in Indonesia have known – it is a skilful and determined enemy that warps, virus-like, into its modern form of economic and intellectual control…’
	Din sighed; it seemed very loud in the unnatural silence around them. ‘How many times have we heard this before?’ he whispered in Adam’s ear. Instinctively, Adam moved away from his hot, sour breath. In those few seconds he had missed what the voice had said, and he, too, began to wish that Din would keep quiet.
	‘…the Indonesian Revolution has become a rocky mountain shooting fire amidst the ocean of mankind’s struggle to build a new world free of exploitation of man by man, free of exploitation of nation by nation. My fellow revolutionaries, there is a phrase in Italian, Vivere Pericoloso. This means, To Live Dangerously. Yes, my brothers! You have understood me. For Indonesia and every other country that strives to be free, this is the Year of Living Dangerously. It is our duty as revolutionaries to do so.’
	At last we’re getting somewhere,’ Din said. He was about to continue when Z lifted a finger to her lips, slowly, almost theatrically; Din’s mouth lay half-open, his chin lifted in defiance, but he fell silent nonetheless. Adam looked at Z’s curiously masculine index finger, poised lightly before – but not touching – her delicate lips. Her gaze alighted briefly on Adam before returning to the radio, as if instructing him to resume listening to the speech.
	‘In the last few hours brave Indonesian soldiers have begun to strike at the heart of this Malaysia that British Imperialists are so proud of. Here is proof of Living Dangerously. Our forces are now just a hundred miles from Kuala Lumpur, where the lackeys of Imperialism cower from us. They thought we were afraid. They thought we would not dare. They thought that the might of America would save them, but it will not. The British and Americans who seek to control the free world will be crushed in South East Asia. They will meet the same fate as the French in Vietnam. In the last few weeks a mighty fleet of British aircraft carriers and destroyers was forced to flee from us. Why? Because I will not allow the enemy’s foot to step upon the proud rampaging Indonesian Bull. It is no longer time to be conciliatory. Our revolution has foes everywhere. We have a duty to attack, to destroy every power, whether foreign or not, native or not, that endangers the security and the continuation of the revolution.’
	Z shifted in her seat. ‘I don’t like the tone of this,’ she said. Her brow was only faintly troubled by a frown, but it was enough of a signal for the others to start a debate:
	‘The country is starving – let’s fight expensive wars with the Americans!’
	‘What a convenient excuse to suppress anyone who dares to oppose him!’
	‘Revolution? What Revolution? He has no ideology. Listen, listen…’
	‘…I know a science that is efficacious, namely Marxism. As you know, I am a friend of communists because communists are revolutionary people, and I am a friend of all revolutionary people, whatever their cause, be it religion or ideology…’
	Z spoke again, more firmly this time. ‘This man is unbelievable. He has no idea what Marxism is. It’s just a word he’s heard. He wants to keep everyone happy but he can’t do so any longer. He shouldn’t be allowed.’
	‘As I wrote in my satirical epic poem in last month’s Z,’ said the long-haired poet, ‘our dear President has supplanted the State in controlling the means of production in a classless society.’
	‘It makes me so angry,’ someone else added, ‘because the economics and demographics of Indonesia would make it an ideal communist state. That’s what my thesis is all about.’
	There were more voices competing for attention now; the radio was forgotten. Din pushed his chair back quietly and tugged at Adam’s elbow. ‘Let’s go,’ he said. Adam did not want to leave. He wanted to hear the things being said. It surprised and excited him to have understood the things they were saying – not everything, of course, but the general sense of it. They were people of his age, people who were not too dissimilar to him, he thought; they were not unschooled kids from the Moluccas but people whose complexities he thought he could understand. He wanted to stay.
	‘Come on,’ Din said, continuing to pull at him. Adam did not resist; he did not want to make a scene." />

He saw a dark amorphous band that seemed to hover just above where he thought the ground should be, erasing all detail of life and obscuring the buildings beyond it. The flags atop the Presidential Palace were just visible above this band of non-colour, but otherwise the city seemed to have disappeared. Perhaps it was the heat that induced this mirage, he thought, or maybe there was something wrong with him. He was very tired. He could not hear anything either, not even when they were quite close to the edge of the mass, this inhuman gathering of humans. The same silence he had experienced with Z surrounded him again, an absence of noise that acquired a weight of its own, like the soundlessness of being underwater. When he dipped his head beneath the waves and kicked until his body skimmed the top of the reef, it was this that he felt: a noiseless void pressing against his temples.
	They stepped into the hot swell of bodies: the sour smell of old clothes on unwashed bodies. Din forced his way through the crush, pushing people aside with one hand, holding on to Adam’s wrist with the other, as if fighting a way through dense foliage. The bodies around them gave way with only minimal resistance; all eyes were fixed on some invisible point in the distance. As they waded deeper into this swamp Adam heard the same voice he had heard before: rhythmic, cajoling, powerful. It was impossible to tell where the speaker was – his voice seemed to be coming from all around them, becoming louder as they pushed further forward. It was more urgent than before, quickening as the beautiful baritone dropped to little more than a whisper, each syllable compressed for emphasis, as insistent as a torrent of water forcing its way through a crack in a wall. It had been more than two hours since the speech had begun, but the voice did not seem to tire.
	Adam could see the Palace now, the brilliant white stone coming into view over the heads of the people in front of them; they were slowing down; the bodies were no longer giving way but standing firm: a wall of slick smooth shirtless torsos. ‘…we approach the moment when each and every individual who cares for the future of humanity must fight…’ Din continued to grip Adam’s wrist even though they had ceased to move; Adam pulled away slightly, taking half a step back, but he was trapped by someone else pressing against him. Suddenly the space around him had disappeared; there was no air, just the stale salty smell of skin and hair that forced its way into his nose and mouth and filled his lungs. There was a movement in the crowd, a tremor that Adam could feel working its way towards him, and then someone stepped on his foot, crushing his toes even as an elbow caught him in the ribcage; and yet he could not fall, for there were bodies around him, pressing tightly on all sides. ‘…we must rise up, rise up and fight, fight, to live as free human beings as god intended…’ There was a cry in the crowd, an indistinct roar of a thousand different words being shouted at once; and again, rising and then dying away sharply like a sudden squall out at sea, when the rains come from nowhere and bear down upon you, churning the waves into a froth before disappearing, leaving everything calm again." />

He knew that his mouth was open, that his chest rose and fell; but he knew, nonetheless, that he was not breathing. Maybe I am going to die, he thought; I am going to die alone, in this sea of skin. He looked for Din but glimpsed only part of his face, for someone was obscuring him. He could still feel Din’s hand on his wrist, though, gripping tightly. Yet he could not locate his wrist – his arm was outstretched, pulled far from his body, and he could not see it. I am going to die, he thought. He felt calm about it. There was nothing he could do about it now. Another cry punctured the air and this time it did not fade away but grew louder: the sound of one million people cheering and shouting. Adam felt his bones vibrate with this noise; he felt quite unable to distinguish it from his own body.
	And suddenly he was on the ground, his head falling onto the dry earth with a dull thud. He pulled his chin into his chest but even as he did so he felt a sharp blow on the back of his skull – a heel crashing into his head. And another one, this time against his ear, filling his head with a hollow ringing that blanked out everything else. He raised both arms to cover his head: Din had let go. He drew his knees up to his face and curled into a ball, and it was better. He felt the heavy tread of feet on his hips and thighs and calves, and the rough jerk of people tripping over him. An immense pressure pushed outwards from within his skull, as if his head was about to split open. The ringing in his ears had turned into a dull rushing noise; he no longer knew where he was." />

It was Din, lifting Adam by his arm, pulling roughly, his fingernails digging into the soft flesh of Adam’s armpit. Now it was he who stepped on prostrate bodies, tripping occasionally and landing heavily, elbows first, on someone’s back. A space appeared around him, and he could see blood on faces and bruises on bare chests and open mouths with split lips. He saw the expressions on these bloody faces: not fear nor anger, but a mixture of exhilaration and emptiness, as if the people who inhabited these bodies had fled long ago. The terrible noise he had heard earlier still hung heavily in the air, but it was fractured now, broken by distinct screams of individual men and women, which Adam could hear even through the blank ringing in his ear. There was another noise too, something he thought he had heard before, a series of short sharp cracks, a pop-pop-pop that came in rapid bursts. Gunfire, he thought to himself, and wondered how he knew that. Later Din would tell him that it was the sound of shots being fired into the air in celebration of the victory of the revolution, to mark this Year of Living Dangerously, but Adam was not so sure.
	Adam concentrated on running. He focused only on following Din, who turned to look at him every so often with a wild-eyed exhilaration. It was too much for him to think of anything else; he ran as fast as he could, trying to keep up with Din on the streets of this vast city, his chest heaving with the effort. He could breathe again, he thought; he could breathe." />

It was about a girl who had fallen terribly in love with a twenty-year-old Spanish boy, a matador, even (or was she just imagining that?) – and she was so crazy with love that she knew her entire existence would be surrendered to the beautiful boy. Margaret remembered nothing of the rest of the story. She retained only a sense of ridicule and mild contempt at the thought that someone could fall so helplessly in love with a person she didn’t know and allow herself to become limp and silly like that. Falling in love is a matter of choice: if you fall in love like that it must mean that you want to; it means you want to lose your mind and self-control. You want to lose your sense of independent existence, yourself. The girl in the novel had been like that. She had known that she was losing her self-respect; she was a trembling wreck. I’m a goner, she had said. It was as if she was beyond salvation; and all due to events beyond her control. It had so irritated Margaret that she had rushed to the end of the book without paying much attention to it. So it was funny that she should remember it now, caught in this riot. Now it was she who was a ‘goner’, but unlike the girl in the novel she was really a goner, and it was due to events that really were beyond her control.

The engine of the Buick was still running, and every so often it would rev up fiercely, a rasping growl that rose above the stampede of feet around them. Bill was doing it, of course, thought Margaret; he was scared too. It was very hot in the car. The windows were wound up tightly and the doors were locked. Amidst the torrent of bodies a face would occasionally appear: someone would stop and press his nose to the window next to Margaret or throw himself across the windscreen with a loud thud, his palms smacking against the glass as he hooted and screamed and jeered, his eyes staring and bloodshot, like some phantom from her sleep; and then he would disappear into the rushing stream once more, vanishing just like a nightmare." />

She could not read the expression on his face – not aggression, not hatred, not lust, not anything in particular, just a blankness that could have been all those things, or none of them. It was an emptiness that frightened Margaret, for there was nothing in his face she could relate to. There were thin veins crisscrossing his yellowed eyes, and his teeth were dark little stumps. He opened his mouth and shouted a word that sounded like BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA that seemed to go on for a whole minute, maybe more, and even through the window Margaret could feel the coarseness of his voice, which was not just a sound but a physical thing that she felt brushing the hairs on the back of her neck.
	‘Don’t look,’ Bill said, ‘don’t look at him. Do not turn your head. Keep your eyes straight ahead.’
	She looked at the hailstorm of feet on the windscreen, but she could not help herself, and she turned once more to look at the face by her side, at the red-and-white bandana and the furry pink tongue. The boy pulled open his shirt to reveal something on his chest. With a knife, he had cut an uneven X across his bony breastbone; it had not fully scabbed over and she could see patches of bright moist blood where the ends of the X reached for his collarbone. He brandished a machete, drawing it across his chest in a gesture that Margaret did not understand, and she thought – again – I’m a goner.

She had dressed nicely, putting on a skirt (something she was now regretting) and a vaguely matching blouse.

They were dressed in the standard uniform of volunteers – too-big khaki shirts, buttoned to the neck, and austere men’s trousers – and their heads were held high, chins lifted in defiance of the unseen enemy that was everywhere. It was always like this on Independence Day. Every other vehicle on the road seemed to be a public bus, commandeered to transport students and people from the outlying villages to the centre of town so that they could hear the President’s address. Everyone else was left to negotiate the city on foot. There was a sudden explosion: mortar shells in the distance, and rifle shots and the piercing shrillness of whistles. An Oplet nearby had broken down, its failing engine filling the air with thick smoke. Margaret lifted the collar of her shirt to cover her mouth and nose. Through the haze she saw figures making their way through the maze of cars. She knew she was not hallucinating: soldiers dressed in full army fatigue, crouching behind cars, their rifles trained on imaginary foes. One of them brushed past her becak, the twigs in his helmet rustling noisily, his radio crackling on and off as he stooped to avoid his mystery foe. She looked around her – people were watching with expressions of boredom; they knew these exercises would soon be over.
	‘What is it this time?’ she shouted through the veil of her shirt.

He was standing in the shadow of a giant column in the shape of a crowbar crowned by a shaft of lightning.
	‘Come and have a look inside,’ Bill said, taking her by the hand. ‘You’ll be amazed.’
	Each of the floors of the building celebrated the vision of modern, independent Indonesia, Bill explained; each storey was seventeen metres high (‘Independence Day – today – August 17, geddit?’), light and airy, made of polished concrete set in curves and angles. Everywhere Margaret looked she saw beautifully made models of highways, railways, waterways, hydro-electric dams, irrigation schemes, hospitals, factories, war planes, spaceships, nuclear plants and luxurious hotels: entire worlds captured in glass cabinets. A modern port – quite unlike the rat-infested docks of Tanjong Priok – bustled with happy workers and angular, futuristic ships. In a Western-style living room, a smiling family sat on an orange sofa, pointing at a TV the size of a small cinema screen, their comfortable home filled with an array of electrical appliances Margaret could not identify. A bridge in the shape of a clover leaf – exactly the same as the one downtown – sat astride a network of streamlined highways, but the city around these roads was not the city Margaret knew. Here, in this other city that was Jakarta and yet not Jakarta, the famous clover-leaf bridge was surrounded by buildings of uniform modernity, and the people were well dressed and clean and healthy, carrying smart briefcases as they went to work. The cars were shiny and the roads tree-lined and clean, and there were children playing next to the canal, which did not look black and slimy like the one she knew. There were no slums in this city.
	‘Officially we’ve stopped all aid to Indonesia, and relations between our countries are at meltdown, but on a personal level nothing’s changed,’ Bill said. He was wearing a light blue shirt, open at the neck to reveal strawberry-blond chest hairs unfurling towards the base of his throat. His sleeves were rolled up to the elbow and he did not look as if he had been in the office. ‘My friends in town still want to see me – there’s still work to be done.’
	‘I like the way you see friends as work,’ Margaret laughed. ‘Is there ever a moment when you let your guard down? I mean, do you ever not think of how everything fits into your master plan of world domination?’
	Bill chuckled; she had forgotten how he looked when he laughed in this way, his cheeks shiny and blushed with red, almost cherubic and certainly unsophisticated. All of a sudden he was an Idaho farmer’s son once more. She could imagine him growing up on a prairie, sitting on the back of a tractor amid bales of hay. ‘Don’t tease me, Margaret Bates. You know I’m defenceless against your wit.’
	‘Oh, not quite that defenceless, particularly when there’s “still work to be done”. Hmm, let me guess what kind of work that might be. Under-the-counter gifts of Rolex watches to your friends? A little Cartier necklace for the wife, perhaps? Or maybe just good old-fashioned greenbacks…’
	He put his hands in his pocket and chuckled his farm-boy laugh again. They were standing beside a model of an offshore oil-rig. The sea was a clear crystal blue and the waves washed calmly on to a white sandy beach; beyond the beach there was a silvery petroleum-processing plant.
	‘I know what you’re going to say,’ Margaret continued. ‘ “We’re fighting a war out there! A war that will decide the future of the world! We cannot let Indonesia fall to communism” – right?’ She dug him in the ribs; she had intended merely to tickle him, but misjudged her lunge and ended up catching him heavily between two ribs. He only flinched a little.
	‘It’s kind of silly, the things we do in the name of ideology,’ he said, staring at the men in hard hats on the deck of the rig. Margaret saw the reflection of his face in the glass; his lips were parted as he smiled, but his eyes seemed to be narrowed in a frown.
	‘Seriously, Bill,’ she said, continuing to watch his reflection. ‘Do you actually have any friends?’
	‘Sure, I know lots of people here.’
	‘No, I mean people who aren’t of use to you in your work, people you like…you know, real friends.’
	‘Look at that,’ he said, touching his index finger to the glass. A turtle floated in the water, a single leatherback drifting calmly in the ocean. ‘He looks kinda happy, don’t you think?’
	‘Guess so. Lots of fish for him to eat – look.’ She pointed at a shoal of mackerel suspended in the glassy ocean.
	Bill put his hand on hers. It sat awkwardly, covering her thumb and index finger, but otherwise it felt smooth and broad. Their hands obscured the oilfield and cast a shadow on the sea, as if a rainstorm was imminent; she could no longer see the fish in the sea, and the fishermen casting nets from their boats seemed suddenly in danger. She looked at the freckles on his wrist and his sturdy waterproof Timex.
	‘We’re not late for the speech, are we?’ she said.

	‘Thanks, Larry,’ Bill said. ‘Sure you don’t want to come and listen to the speech with us? We have front-row seats.’
	Larry frowned, his pale features twisted with confusion. ‘You gotta be mad, Bill. No way – I’m planning to stay home and enjoy the President’s speech on the radio, like any sane human being.

Their red-and-white bandanas and painted faces were meant to make them look fearsome, but Margaret found it difficult to take them seriously. They looked like children on their way to a tea party where they would play musical chairs and pin the tail on the donkey (it was so easy to imagine the bandana as a blindfold). It was precisely because they wanted to look like Dayak warriors, thought Margaret, that she found them so ridiculous. She could not help giggling whenever she saw their snarling faux-fierce faces on the street – they looked frail and pathetic in their flip-flops and nylon shorts and faded T-shirts that said Come Alive! You’re in the Pepsi Generation. There were groups of young women, too, soberly dressed in slacks and blouses, carrying banners that proclaimed them to be REVOLUTIONARY WOMEN OF GOD or YOUNG WOMEN STRIVING
	FOR THE GOODNESS OF MANKIND. You could always tell the university students, too – they were always just that bit neater, in spite of the effort some of them made to appear scruffy, to blend in with their brothers on the streets. Margaret scanned the crowd for any of her former students. She could say that with some confidence: former. There had not been classes for some weeks now, and she doubted she would ever teach again. A group of women went past, singing the President’s name in a childish monotone.
	‘What happened to your girlfriend, Bill?’ Margaret said, looking out of the window.
	‘What do you mean? I haven’t got a girlfriend.’ The car had slowed to near-walking speed as Bill eased through the crowd.
	‘Come on, I mean that girl you were with a few days ago at the Hotel Java. Susie, or whatever her name was.’
	‘Oh, that one. It never really got off the ground. I wasn’t very serious – I never am with local girls. Hell, it’s difficult.’ He cast a quick glance at Margaret, frowning slightly, then looked away again, concentrating on the thick soup of people ahead of them. ‘You must think I’m a real jerk, but it’s not easy, you know, working at my job, being with the Embassy…it’s hard just being in this city. Oh shoot, you don’t know what I’m trying to say, do you? I can see it on your face. You’re OK here, you get along in this place. You adapt. I mean, really adapt. Me, I’m different, Margaret. I know what you think of me. I’m just this brute, this ugly Yank who doesn’t get life abroad, who’s so American he’ll never understand foreigners–’

Bill wound down the window, but none of the soldiers seemed interested enough to approach the car.
	‘We need to get through,’ Bill called out. ‘We have an appointment at the Palace. Let us pass immediately or else we will be late.’ When Bill spoke Indonesian he sounded stilted, magisterial; Margaret had always thought it was a language that suited him, but she was not so sure now.
	The soldiers laughed; Margaret was not sure what they were laughing at.
	‘This barricade is barricading our progress,’ Bill continued in his efficient Embassy voice. ‘We have the right to proceed immediately.’
	One of the soldiers walked towards the car. He cradled his machine gun in his arms with such ease that it seemed part of his body. ‘American,’ he said. Margaret could not tell if he was asking them or merely stating something he already knew.
	‘Yes, American. From Embassy people,’ Bill said, tapping his watch. His Indonesian was faltering. ‘Must pass now, with quickness, appointment Palace.’
	The soldier half-smiled, half-sneered. His eyes were invisible behind his sunglasses.
	‘Please, sir, could you let us through?’ Margaret leaned over and smiled at the soldier. ‘We are guests at the Palace and it would be very rude of us to be late for the President’s speech. We’ve been looking forward to it for such a long time.’
	‘Yes,’ Bill added sternly. ‘People no rude.’
	The soldier turned to look at his friends, momentarily uncertain of what to do.
	Margaret said, ‘If you need to check with your superior, please do so. You can say that we are with the US Embassy. We have papers, if you need to see them.’
	‘Hurriedly, pressure, now.’
	‘Shut up, Bill.’
	The soldier turned back to face them. ‘Who says you can go to the Palace on the President’s speech day?’
	Bill smacked both hands on the steering wheel and let out a sharp sigh. ‘We have authority got. Minister important. Minister Hartono immediate. Call his office quick to confirmation.’
	The soldier laughed, his teeth flashing brilliantly in the sunshine. ‘Hartono. Hartono!’ He called out to his friends, repeating the name several times. Margaret could hear their staccato laughs, punctuated by smokers’ coughs. ‘The man of whom you speak, the man who is one of your dirty corrupt puppets, he is no longer a minister. He is no longer one of the people who work for you.’
	‘Unbelieve. Call Minister Hartono now.’
	The soldier shrugged. ‘Your puppy dog Hartono has been…removed from office. We are not expecting him to return.’
	‘This lies! Yesterday I telephone speak him.’
	‘And this morning he is in prison. I’m asking you to leave now, sir, but I am not going to ask you politely again.’ There was a slight change in the way he held his gun; a minute shift, but enough for Margaret to notice it.
	‘OK, OK, OK,’ Bill said." />

Everywhere they looked they saw only a shifting wall of people. No right turn, no left turn, no straight ahead. The city had disappeared in this growing swell of bodies. The car inched along. Every so often a passing kid would drum on the bonnet with his palms, and sometimes people would boo and jeer comically as they went past. Ameri-ka, piss off home. That kind of thing. Bill told her to wind the windows up, and so she did. She was not afraid.
	And now she found herself trapped in the car, wearing a skirt, sitting next to a man who was protecting them both with a single revolver. She could not remember when it was, or how it was, that her life had changed so much that she could be reassured by a man with a gun. She had lost track of how long they had been in the car before the riot began; she had forgotten when it was, precisely, that she first thought: I’m a goner. She used to be able to remember such details, the exact moments in time when important things happened to her. There had been a time in her life when she could recall entire conversations, the tone and inflection of someone’s voice as they spoke, the way they pronounced a single word. The way they said, quietly, I shall never forget you.
	She closed her eyes and tried to remember. She tried to shut out the hollow banging of feet on the roof of the car and replace the noise with the voices that she had known in the past. There, she could just about do it. She had to hang on to what remained of her memories, she told herself, for they would return. Surely they would return." />

	‘Shh,’ Karl raised a finger to his lips and frowned at her with an expression of theatrical severity. They were being shown round the home of a famous artist, a flamboyant German with a penchant for ‘parrots and boys’, according to Margaret’s mother.
	‘And this one, ah, this one, I am ashamed to say, is my humble attempt at capturing the spirit of Bali,’ the artist said, indicating a gouache of the inevitable rice terraces presided over by a kindly demon. ‘But sadly I don’t know if I am ever successful in achieving what I hope to achieve.’ He spoke in a manner that suggested neither recognition of failure nor humility.
	‘Oh, Walter,’ Margaret said, ‘show Karl something more racy. Mother says you have the naughtiest paintings of men and women bathing in rivers.’
	Their host raised an eyebrow and smiled. ‘I have many pictures of great sensuality, it is true, but none of those are by me. I’d rather show you my own work – and besides, you’re far too delicate and innocent to appreciate those images.’
	‘I’m not delicate,’ Margaret protested.
	‘Yes, but your new friend is,’ Walter said, drawing his hand in a wristy, tender twirl in front of Karl’s face before moving on. ‘This, my dear young friends, is one of my early works. Done when I was still living in Germany. You might like it, dear boy, coming as you do from a country full of rural traditions.’
	‘Yes, it’s very…arresting,’ Karl said, moving closer to the painting and feigning interest. Margaret coughed and looked away, beyond the veranda, across the valley to a ridge of palm trees. If she looked at Karl she would burst into laughter, she knew that.
	‘Margaret, really, look at this,’ Karl urged, taking her arm and guiding her towards a small frameless oil painting of a darkened farmhouse, the fields around it lit by yellow moonlight. Misshapen, skinny black-and-white cows stood in the pastures, and over this surrealist idyll there drifted a young bride and groom, suspended in the night sky.
	Margaret giggled. ‘Oh, isn’t it whimsical,’ she said, recovering quickly.
	‘This little tableau,’ said Walter, ‘is full of my conflicting emotions towards my homeland. Nostalgia, longing, but also fear and self-loathing and darkness – all those things are contained in this tiny piece. I did not realise this when I painted it many years ago. When one is young’ – he raised his eyebrow and turned to look at Margaret – ‘one does not see such things. But now, in the long autumn of my life, I can appreciate all the happiness and indeed the despair that has coloured my life.’ He waved his hand at the painting as if to prove his point." />

Her body heaved with the sheer pleasure of laughing out loud, hot tears filling her eyes. Karl put his arm around her shoulders and she could feel the comforting warmth of his body as he shook uncontrollably with mirth. ‘Regard this petit tableau’, he said, mimicking Walter’s languid vowels. Margaret opened her mouth to speak but was unable to stitch her words into a sentence. Wiping her eyes, she thought, This is what it means to be happy. Her entire life stretched out before her, an eternity waiting to be filled with the same delirious, light-headed joy. She felt as if the clouds had parted on a cool overcast day and the sun shone down on a small patch of earth upon which she, and only she, existed. How had she survived the first fifteen years of her life without knowing such dizzy pleasure, she wondered?
	They reached a spot on the ridge where a line of trees thinned out to offer them a view of the valley. ‘Could we stop for a moment?’ Karl said, sitting on the grass. It had not rained in a while and the grass was already looking dry, flecked with brown.
	‘You know, I’ve never sat on the grass in the Indies before,’ Margaret said as she sat down beside him, crossing her legs in a half-lotus. ‘It feels weird – a very European thing to do.’
	‘Never?’ he said, running his palm over the grass lightly, as if enjoying the texture of a fine rug.
	She shook her head. ‘It’s not that surprising. I mean, there are bugs and snakes and things in Asian grass. It’s not welcoming the way European grass is, you know – not that I know what European grass is like. I’d like Europe, I think – pleasant green meadows of delicate flowers and forests that aren’t teeming with animals that eat you. And those lovely clean cities with sewage systems – I mean, Paris sounds wonderful.’
	Karl looked across the valley, the smile still set in his face, but his eyes had gone blank. ‘I love sitting on the grass here. Or on the sand, the way locals do.’
	The land fell away sharply before them, a steep bank of velvet-green shrubs that led to the river below. Margaret could see children bathing in its silver-blue water; where it flowed into deep pools the water was still and dark, almost black, and reflected the wispy clouds on that day of brilliant weather.
	‘Sitting on this grass,’ Karl said, ‘I can almost remember being an infant in Buru. Almost. I pretend I can. But I can’t really.’
	Margaret looked across at him and put her hand on his. He did not look at her, but continued staring down at the children splashing in the gentle current of the shallows. He did not blink, and there was a hollowness in his gaze that made Margaret feel that she ought to do something to fill that emptiness and make his eyes shine again.
	‘Can’t you remember anything?’ she said. ‘I can. I can remember things that happened to me when I was two.’ She laughed, but he did not respond.
	‘I can remember my babu,’ he said at last. ‘Not her face or eyes or nose or any details; I just remember her being there with me and then suddenly disappearing. I can remember my father shouting and my mother crying. A house that was very silent – apart from my father’s tantrums and my mother’s sobbing. But most of all, my babu. I remember her because I remember missing her when we went back to Holland. I remember asking for her, long after we had moved back to The Hague, asking when Babu was going to come back, but no one would ever answer. She was a proper babu, you know – she nursed me. My own mother couldn’t express milk when I was born. When we were back in Holland, whenever I got ill – which was often – she would say, “You’re such a weak child because you were nursed by that woman.”’
	‘That’s awful.’ Margaret noticed that Karl made no attempt to remove his hand from hers. ‘You weren’t really ill that often, were you?’
	‘All the time. I hated The Hague. I hated that house. Now that I can remember. It had very low ceilings with beams that were painted black, and you could see the cobwebs forming on them, silky balls of fluff that I always wanted to touch. There was a small window in my room at the top of the house. Half the view was obscured by the sloping roof, and in the winter, when the snow settled on the tiles, all I could see was this blurred screen of white, and in the distance the grey of the sky. I would lie in bed with the sheets pulled up to my face, and the woollen blankets would tickle my nose. I never got used to wool. And I would feel the cold seeping into my chest, and I would know that I was falling ill. I think I had probably forgotten about Buru by then, but my body hadn’t. It always craved warmth. When the other children put on their hats and gloves and went skating, I knew that I wasn’t one of them, that I was from somewhere else. At school, during history lessons, whenever the teacher said, “We conquered” or “We civilised them,” it took me a while to understand who we and they were. Isn’t it bizarre? On those cold days I used to imagine myself as a child in Buru, or somewhere else in the Indies – here, for example. I would recreate scenes. And in these scenes I was playing in the sun, swimming – oh yes, that’s another thing I can remember from Buru, the sea. I would imagine myself playing with other local kids, imagine how the sand felt between my toes and my fingers. And that consoled me. Because I thought to myself, One day I will be there again. I didn’t know when, but in the way that children do, I thought it could happen at any moment – and I would be a child in the Indies again. But then, of course, well…’
	He smiled at Margaret – a smile that seemed as frail and ephemeral as a butterfly, so delicate that she feared she might crush it if she touched it. She reached out and touched his cheek, barely brushing his skin with the back of her hand, her fingers feeling the softness of his face. She wished her fingers were not so bony; she wished she did not have knobbly knuckles, but the gracefully curved fingers of Balinese child dancers. He put his hand over hers, pressing her hand gently between his cheek and his palm, holding it like this for a few seconds; a minute; a lifetime. And then he leant his head and rested it on her shoulder. She could no longer see his face, but could smell his hair – a sweet milky odour. She said, ‘But then what?’
	‘What?’
	‘You said, “But then…” only you didn’t finish your sentence.’ She began to stroke his hair, drawing her fingers lightly through the long silken strands.
	‘I didn’t know how to express what I was thinking.’
	‘You were going to say, But then we grow up and we find we don’t have our childhood any more. Is that right?’
	She felt the tiniest movement of his head, an imperceptible nod. ‘It’s not so bad, being an adult,’ she continued. ‘I wish I were an adult. Officially, I mean.’
	‘You are very grown up indeed, young madam.’
	‘I can’t say I ever had a childhood. I’ve been like this ever since I can remember. Grown up, that is.’
	He lifted his head and looked at her. The darkness in his eyes had lifted, she thought. ‘There’s something else,’ he said, hesitating, waiting for her approval, it seemed, before he continued. His gaze dropped, and he began drawing his palm in little circles on the dry grass once again. Margaret did not say anything. His forehead was so close to her face that she could have leaned forward and planted a kiss on it, right on the thin crease in the middle of his brow. ‘There was something else I used to imagine. It was this: when I imagined being different from the other Dutch kids, it wasn’t simply because I had lived somewhere else. I believed – I made myself believe – that it was because I really wasn’t like them. That I wasn’t Dutch. Shh. Don’t say anything’ – he reached out and put a finger to her lips; it was cool and very steady – ‘let me tell you, otherwise I’m never going to be able to share it with anyone ever again. I used to tell myself that I was only partly Dutch, that my babu was my real mother. Isn’t that silly? It didn’t seem silly when I was six or seven. It felt real, and it comforted me. One day my father was in a very good mood, I don’t know why. We were eating pancakes and apples. He said, “When I was a young man in the Indies, pancakes were the food I missed most from home; none of the babu I had could learn how to make them properly.” And my mother said, “Well the last babu learnt many things from you.” Looking back, it probably meant nothing at all, absolutely nothing, but that day I took it as proof that my babu was my real mother. And as I grew older I would make this history more elaborate. I would imagine my father taking the boat from Buru to Batavia to search for a European wife and falling in love instead with a local girl, and taking her back to Buru. He would go to Holland on home leave, and there he would meet my mother, but when they returned to Buru they would find the babu pregnant – with me. The funny thing is, the more I thought about it, the more I began to live it. Sometimes the boys at school used to accuse me of being an Indo – you know, a Eurasian. Look.’ He put his arm against hers so that their forearms touched from elbow to wrist. ‘See? You’re pale, I’m much darker in comparison.’
	Margaret did not honestly see any difference, but she nodded anyway. He laughed and pinched her cheek. ‘I told you it was silly,’ he said. ‘I don’t suppose you’ve ever had childish imaginings.’
	She shook her head. ‘No, can’t think of any. I’m really quite dull. I told you: childhood just passed me by.’
	They stood up and began walking. The dappled shade of the trees cast intricate patterns over Karl’s face as he talked. ‘I’ve never told anyone what I’ve told you,’ he said, ‘and I don’t expect I shall ever repeat it to anyone. I don’t think I shall ever need to.’
	Margaret shrugged and poked him in the ribs. ‘No one else would have the patience with you.’
	‘That’s just it. You…I don’t know, you seem to understand me. We’re similar, don’t you think? I used to feel I was all alone in the world, but maybe I’m not.’
	‘You’ve finally found someone as bizarre as you are, you mean?’
	Karl laughed. ‘Do you think I should get married to a local woman and have lots of children? I want to have an Indonesian child. A boy. He’ll be my alter ego, except better, and happier – all the things I could have been, but wasn’t. We’ll live in a house by the sea, just like the one in Buru that I remember as a child, only this time there’ll be no unhappiness, just laughter and gifts.’
	‘I think that is a really, really bad idea,’ Margaret said, laughing, as she linked her arm into his. The path began to descend, curving round to point them back in the direction of the village. There were clove trees on either side of the path; and in a field there was a plump cow that looked up at Margaret with big bright eyes. The houses on the edge of the village began to come into view, perched on the far side of the ridge, half-hidden by vegetation. The sun was still high, its reflection flashing now and then in tiny starbursts on the surface of the river below.
	Karl said, ‘I never believed I could be so happy.’" />

	They went into the bar. At the end of the narrow corridor, away from the noise of the street, there was another door, and on the door there was a poster of a young woman wearing a wet T-shirt. Reach for Flavour Winston of America, she said. It was dark, the corridor lit only by a single fluorescent strip that glowed and flickered, and Johan could not make out if the girl was Chinese or Malay or Eurasian. Maybe she was just a Westerner pretending to be Asian. There was quite a lot of that nowadays.
	It was not a big room, but there were many people there, and the air was heavy with cigarette smoke, a silvery veil that made it difficult to discern people’s faces, and even when he blinked he could not tell who was who. He thought he recognised someone – a face here, a long sweep of hair there, a flash of shiny beads on a handbag which he thought he had seen before, but then again maybe not.
	Johan, wait, don’t go too fast, Farah whispered. She was holding his hand tightly and staying very close, so close he could feel the hesitant warmth of her body against his, her knee knocking into the back of his thigh as she said, Don’t let go of me, please don’t leave me alone.
	Don’t worry, I’m right here.
	There was music now, something bright and brassy, a trumpet or a saxophone starting up, then some tin drums and castanets. Not this Mambo Rock shit again, said Bob as they eased into an alcove deep in the shadows where they could not be seen. A row of lights came on, one by one, and the chatter of the audience turned into a rowdy cheer. There was clapping and some men were whistling. There was no curtain, no elaborate introduction, just some girls on stage who appeared all of a sudden through the smoke, moving their hips from side to side, out of synch with the music, as if it was their first time and they were not sure what to do in this place. They were wearing only panties decorated with gold beads dangling from the end of thin filaments of thread, and when they shook their hips the beads shimmered through the hazy blue smoke in the room. Over the powdery whiteness of their bare torsos there seemed to be a thin slick of sweat, only more viscous, as if it would be cold and almost firm to the touch, Johan thought. Over their nipples the girls wore silver stars that shone in the harsh glare of the lights and appeared to Johan almost like real stars shining through clouds." />

Some foreigners had come to the village and they had presents for all the children, old toy cars and clothes and bags of boiled sweets wrapped in coloured cellophane. They gave Johan a globe filled with fake snow and a miniature Eiffel Tower. At the base of the tower there were tiny people playing in the snow, children, maybe, and when he turned the globe upside down the children did not fall but remained glued to their places instead. And when you returned them to their rightful position it would be snowing on them, the flakes swirling around before settling at the feet of the motionless children. Adam spent hours looking at this miniature world, turning the globe on its head and then back again. He set it on the window sill and watched the sunlight refracting through the glass, bathing the children in rainbow colours. Don’t be stupid, Johan said, laughing, there can’t be snow and sun at the same time, but Adam did not mind. Do you think we will ever see snow? he asked, and Johan said, No, probably not, because you don’t like being cold.
	Afterwards, the foreigners who had given them the presents put on a play about the birth of the baby Jesus. They dressed up as shepherds and donkeys and they chose one of the orphaned babies to be Jesus, and wrapped him up in cloth. Above them, a bright silver star they had made hung from the ceiling against patches of damp and mould, but if you stared at it long enough you could just about pretend you were looking at the night sky. Adam asked, What is going to happen to the baby? And one of the foreigners said, Well, he will die to save mankind from sin. To sin is to do something bad, something wrong, the foreigner explained. We are all sinners, you and I both. And Adam was so sad afterwards that he did not speak. He sat staring out of the window, at the fields that were dry and barren that year, scarred by patches of ash where there had been fires. Johan gave him the snow-globe to make him feel better. Adam said, We are sinners, that is why we are orphans, aren’t we? That’s why we are alone and no parents want us. No, said Johan, no, you’ve done nothing wrong. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. I’m right here." />

	But the main attraction hasn’t even begun, Bob said. Oh wait, my god, here she comes.
	The music changed suddenly to a cha-cha, and some men in the audience stood up and whistled. The clapping was louder now, and people were smacking their hands on the table. Johan could barely hear the music. The girls hurried off stage, shoving each other as they disappeared into the wings, and all the lights went out, except one, which was trained on a high wooden stool. A woman walked on to the stage, dressed as the girls were, but she had her arms crossed across her chest, hands delicately touching her neck to form a W that hid the top half of her torso. She turned her back to the crowd, twisting her head to glance over her shoulder, smiling a coquette’s coy smile. Then she slowly spread her arms and held them outstretched. The flesh on her arms drooped and her thighs were ample. Two men appeared from the wings dressed in cheap dinner suits. They were holding a snake, a python whose skin was patterned with black and gold diamonds. They draped the snake across the woman’s shoulders and across her chest, and she turned to face the audience, the reptile curling itself languidly around her breasts, its tail flickering downwards, reaching for the space between her thighs until she halted it with one hand. To catcalls and applause she threw back her head and closed her eyes, feeling the smooth cold touch of the snakeskin with her cheek, thrusting her chest forward in fake ecstasy.
	Farah said, This is sick. I’m leaving now, Johan. Don’t care if you come or not. On stage the woman was struggling with the python, her face contorting in an expression between pain and ecstasy as the snake’s thick coils tightened around her body. Johan did not know if she was pretending or if the pain was real. He eased his way through the crowd, through the messy chorus of whistles and hand-clapping that accompanied every exaggerated motion on stage. He did not look back." />

	Don’t be angry, he said, reaching out to hold her hand. It’s just a bit of fun. She had bunched her hand into a fist, and he held the tightly knotted ball until he felt her fingers relax and loosen.
	I hope no one’s seen us here, she said, still looking away. It would be so shameful if anyone did. Mummy and Daddy would die of shame.
	Daddy’s probably in there somewhere, we just didn’t look hard enough.
	She glared at him with narrowed eyes and he felt her hand tense up once more, pulling away from him. What is the matter with you? You have such a good family and yet you are so angry all the time. Why? Just tell me: Why?
	I don’t know, I don’t know. He tried to reach out to her but she shrank away from him again. I’m sorry, Farah, it just feels that there’s nowhere for me to go. When I think of this life ahead of me I see so many empty years. Don’t look at me as if I’m crazy. You know what I mean. There’s nothing left for me, Farah. Sometimes I…sometimes I just want it all to end.
	Nothing left for you? That makes me so angry. See how much Mummy loves you? She loves you more than she loves me and Bob put together, and yet you behave like some, some…I don’t know what. OK, so you’re an orphan, so what? Think about what could have happened to you, what would have happened if you hadn’t come to us. You might be an urchin, or you might be dead…god knows what happens to all those other orphans.
	It was he who turned away this time. The street lamps that lit the broad avenue before them were too bright, he thought. Cars flashed by, their headlights adding to the glare, bleaching the darkness from the night. He wished the city were darker, without any light at all.
	Farah leaned against the car, looking away. He thought she was going to touch him but she did not. I’m sorry, she said. I didn’t mean to remind you of your brother.
	He did not answer.
	You know what Mummy says, Farah continued, we shouldn’t talk about it. But I want to know, Johan. Tell me about your brother, I want to understand. Oh, abang, don’t look so unhappy. What happened? Just tell me. You’ll feel better. Don’t cry. Don’t cry.

We had three hundred years of suffering under the Dutch and now we think anything will be better, even this’ – he jabbed his finger at Adam again. ‘So I ask you, is it better to be oppressed by a foreigner or by someone of your own race? Oh my god, you’re so stupid, you don’t understand what I’m saying. Let me put it another way: Is it better to suffer because of someone you hate or someone you love?’ But even as he pointed accusingly at Adam once more, Adam noticed his eyelids had become thick and dark, and he was blinking to try and keep himself awake. ‘Is it?’ he repeated in a half-slur, and then sank slowly from his upright position onto the mat.

There was a sheet hanging over the window, screening the room from the fierce morning sun; the light fell on the floor in funny swirly patterns – translucent sea creatures that wriggled, disappeared and reappeared each time the sheet shifted. Adam listened for Din but could not hear him. He did not know what time Din had left; it must have been not long after dawn, just after Din had risen to observe Azan Suboh.

A box of buttons lay next to her, and in her lap there was a small tray containing rolls of thread. In the palms of her upturned hands there were a few buttons attached loosely to a length of thread. Adam peered down the corridor in search of a toilet but there was only another bedroom and a minuscule open kitchen, beyond which lay the narrow empty street in this agglomeration of houses that was neither a suburb nor a slum but something in between, something that wanted to be decent and clean but appeared squalid and threatening. His need to relieve himself became instantly more pressing as he realised there was no toilet; he would have to urinate in the street, into a canal or onto a pile of rubbish as he had seen others do since his arrival in Jakarta. Just a few days ago he had been shocked by this lack of shame, by the dirtiness of the people of this city, but now he was learning that it was not a question of modesty but one of need. There were no bushes in this neighbourhood, nothing he could use to hide, and so he, too, would have to debase himself in public." />

Her voice was terse and insistent, and she took no notice of Din’s protests as she spoke. They stopped as soon as they noticed Adam.
	‘Don’t worry,’ Din said immediately, ‘I’ve spoken to Margaret. She knows I’m looking after you.’
	‘Hi, Adam,’ Z said. ‘I hear you had an interesting day yesterday. Shame you decided to leave us early. You might actually have learnt something about the politics of this country.’
	‘But I did want to stay,’ Adam said. ‘It wasn’t my fault.’
	Din broke into cheery laughter. ‘This boy just cracks me up! You’re only saying that because there’s a pretty girl here, aren’t you? Yesterday you told me you were tired and you wanted to leave. You said you didn’t understand a word those university students were saying.’
	‘But–’ Adam protested.
	‘Then, as we were leaving, we accidentally got caught up in the riot, didn’t we? It’s not as if we went and joined some hard-core violent youth group. Isn’t that right, Adam? Z thinks we’ve been mixed up with the wrong people and wants us to denounce all violent activity. But what violence have we been involved in? None, right?’
	Adam shook his head. The pressure on his bladder was becoming intolerable.
	Z looked at Adam with wide, expectant eyes, as if awaiting a more elaborate answer. He thought: She doesn’t believe me.
	‘Just remember,’ she said, turning to Din once again, ‘that if you are involved with any violent factions, pro or anti Sukarno, you will lose all the support you enjoy now. You won’t be able to write for Z magazine, and we will inform the university council of your unlawful activities, which will mean that you will lose your office, your stipend and the use of university facilities. In addition, you won’t be able to vote in any matters of student politics.’ Adam could not help but admire the fluency with which she spoke, the effortless articulation of each word. It was clear that she was angry, but she managed nonetheless to sound restrained, almost polite.
	Din took half a step towards her but then turned sharply away, head bowed. The muscle at the top of his jaw twitched, and he said nothing for a few moments. When he spoke he was smiling again – a bright, cheery smile that Adam found frightening. ‘So this is what you educated communists do, is it? Kick out anyone who disagrees with you.’
	‘Don’t play the victim. You know the rules,’ Z said calmly.
	‘You treat people with as much cruelty as your enemies do. In fact, I don’t know who your enemies are – come to think of it, I’m not sure you do either. People to you are just stray dogs, non-sentient creatures who become pawns to your ideology. And you know what? Your whole life is just that – an ideology, no, an idea. There’s nothing concrete about it.’
	Z folded the piece of paper she was holding and tucked it into Din’s shirt pocket. ‘I don’t think I need to get into a useless argument. Here’s a list of the things you are accused of. You know we’ve always believed in non-violent agitation. There’s been too much bloodshed in the history of this country as it is.’
	‘Non-violent agitation,’ Din mocked as Z turned away from him. She moved towards her bicycle, which stood propped up against a tangle of old planks and rusty wire. ‘Adam,’ she said, as she began wheeling the bicycle on to the street, ‘please do not allow yourself to fall under the influence of someone with a misguided view of life, someone who’s trying to avenge some imagined personal injustice. What’s going on is not about one person, it’s about a whole country. You’re a clever person, anyone can see that. You’ve a bright future and you have a lot to offer.

	‘We have nowhere to go. This is all we have, Adam,’ Din continued, pointing vaguely with a quick flick of his hand to the area behind the house.

He just wanted to escape the sound of Din’s voice. He winced every time Din said ‘you and I’ or ‘we’. At first Adam had thought that Din might have been referring to ‘we the Indonesian people’, or ‘we who are not the government’, or ‘we who are not them’; now it was clear that ‘we’ meant all of those, but in particular the ‘we’ that consisted of Adam and Din. He did not like the idea of belonging to a unit made up of himself and Din, which in turn belonged to some hazy group that seemed to include the million shirtless people who had been at the rally at the Palace, but not, it would seem, Z or Margaret or Karl. Adam especially did not like it when Din said, ‘We have no home.’ He hated it because he knew it was true.
	He reached a pontoon that jutted out over a stretch of stagnant black water. A sharp smell of ammonia – of urine soaking into sun-baked, rotting timber – hung in the air; and underneath this odour was the rich stench of excrement. A young woman stood before a rusty water tank, dowsing herself with bowlfuls of water; through her wet sarong Adam could see that she was pregnant, and he averted his eyes. Flimsy panels of broken wood provided scant privacy on the jetty. With a sudden sense of horror Adam thought, I am meant to relieve myself there, in one of those half-open compartments, with a woman standing a few yards away from me. But he had no choice: he stepped on to the platform, wondering if it would give way, and stood facing the stretch of water. Patches of brown scum floated past him, held together by rafts of foam. Underneath the platform he could hear the sound of small creatures scrabbling along the muddy bank, their feet dipping occasionally into the water. Through the gaps in the timber he could see someone – a man – squatting in the compartment next to him; the sweet smoke from his kretek relieved the stink of the canal, and Adam was glad for it. He thought maybe he too would take up smoking. Across the canal some children were kicking a takraw ball whose frayed edges spun messily every time it went up into the air, like the fireworks the Chinese kids let off during their lunar new year." />

	‘But I need some clean clothes,’ Adam protested. ‘Why can’t we just go back and wait there for her? I want to go home.’
	Din approached him and sniffed theatrically. ‘You smell OK,’ he said. And did you say home? Margaret’s house is not your home. Perdo is not your home, not as long as you share it with that white man. This is your home’ – he waved his arms in the air, drawing a large semi-circle above his head – ‘the revolutionary Republic of Indonesia. And you are going to be one of its new heroes, a true revolutionary, like me.’
	‘You?’ Adam said. ‘Me?’ His ribs began to hurt again – a nasty twinge that ran down the side of his body every time he breathed. He felt tired, and he did not wish to be a revolutionary. All he wanted was to go home, wherever that was.
	‘Yes,’ Din replied, lowering his voice as if about to divulge a secret. His face, which had been set firmly in a scowl, softened into a smile. He put his arm round Adam’s shoulders and guided him back to the house. ‘I will look after you, don’t worry. I know you’re confused, but trust me: everything will turn out OK. I know it’s difficult, but you must try and believe in me.’
	Adam wished the pain in his ribcage would go away. It made him feel weak and slightly teary, and his head was beginning to spin. He thought he heard the crackle of static, a fuzzy hum punctuated by low voices, a snatch of a soaring coloratura, the news, hail, hail, we progress, pride in our nation. He began to feel nauseous, his knees suddenly weak. The sounds hovered at the edge of his consciousness. He did not know what was happening to him. He leaned against Din’s wiry, surprisingly solid frame as they made their way back to the house.
	‘Hey, hey,’ Din said, ‘you’re looking pale. You need to sit down for a minute. It’s very hot today. You’re probably starving too. Let’s go to Glodok and get some Chinese food – how about that, huh?’

Independence Day: he recalled the small feast they would have each year in the village, red-and-white flags hanging from the eaves of houses; and later, a present from Karl.
	Yesterday was his birthday, Adam remembered, and he began to feel an emptiness in his chest. He was suffering, and it was because of someone he loved. Maybe if he hated Karl he would feel less bad.

There was another bowl-shaped rattan chair and a small armchair which Mick occupied, the stoutness of his frame making it seem like a piece of children’s furniture. There was no table, no cabinet – nothing in which to store the various objects that lay scattered across the floor like the aftermath of an amateurish burglary: two pairs of sneakers, a badminton racquet and three worn shuttlecocks, files, heaps of books, a broken radio, a postcard of Hobart’s Beautiful Waterfront and a porcelain dish painted with the face of a very young Chairman Mao which Mick had used as an ashtray. On the inelegant bookshelves, propped up against some paperback novels, there was a photo of Mick as a child, aged four or five, dressed in a tweed jacket and stripey tie, seated on a bicycle. His mother was bending over to hold onto the handlebars, her head tilted up to look at the camera. Though she was a heavy woman her features were fine, almost fragile, with an aquiline nose and narrow dark eyes that belonged to antique, oriental lands – a kinder, gentler world, Margaret thought. Her wavy hair was brushed to one side and held together with a small clip, and her dress was austere and black, the kind of thing she looked too young to wear.
	‘I think she was Ottoman Turk,’ Mick said. ‘My father was always saying she wasn’t pure Greek. It was their little joke, something he always teased her about – though the whole Greek thing didn’t ever mean much to me when I was growing up in the suburbs of Melbourne. My father wasn’t a thin man either, so you see: I’m destined for obesity.’
	Margaret laughed. ‘There you go again, blaming everything on others.’
	‘At least I’m predictable. Listen, you should get some rest. You’ve had one hell of a day. Adam will turn up tomorrow, I’m sure.’

She pulled at her skirt, trying to straighten it; she wished it were longer, that it reached all the way down to her ankles like a chaste Muslim robe.
	‘You know what? You should be doing my job and I should be doing yours – you’re good at putting yourself in danger, and I’d be very good sitting in an office doing aimless research.’
	‘Good night, Mick. See you tomorrow. Not too early. Let’s give ourselves a break.’

The development of Weltevreden coincided with the sharp rise in Dutch military activity in the East Indian archipelago during the first decades of the nineteenth century, boosted by the arrival of Governor-General Daendels, whose nickname, the Iron Marshal (or the Thunder Lord, or any of the half-dozen names by which he is known to Indonesian school children), gives some idea as to Dutch attitudes of the time. Under Daendels’ rule, Weltevreden saw the construction of military barracks and houses with neoclassical façades for high-ranking army officers and civil servants. Enormous new administrative buildings were constructed using the stones from the dismantled fort, and lavish celebrations were held at the army club (called, one can only assume ironically, the Concordia). Each time a new island in the Indonesian archipelago was conquered, or whenever a Javanese prince submitted his lands to Dutch rule, appropriate celebrations would be held – an open-air concert, perhaps, where bands would play French operettas and finely dressed Europeans would drive up in their carriages and form a wide circle around the musicians, presaging the drive-in cinemas that would one day exist in this part of central Jakarta. At the heart of Weltevreden lay a pure green space, one square kilometre: Koenigsplein; at various times a racecourse, a pleasure ground and a military training ground. The whole of Utrecht would fit in it, the Dutch would say, laughing, as they passed the square on their way to drinks at the Harmonie Club or a play at the Schouwburg.
	There were, of course, setbacks in this happy existence. Soldiers would return gravely wounded from the bloody guerrilla war in Aceh; they would be sent to recuperate in the great army hospital that stood on the edge of Koeningsplein, an ever-present reminder to the inhabitants of Weltevreden of the true nature of their lives in the East Indies. Some were foolhardy young men who were fond of saying that the greatest enemy in the Indies was boredom, but the truth was that there were many ways to die in the Indies; death lurked in the shadows, often well disguised. If you were a white man there was only one thing to do: make as much money as you could and get back to Europe as quickly as possible. This is what older, wiser men said to themselves as they went past the hospital, whispering a silent prayer of thanks. Today the emptiness of Koenigsplein has been replaced by the emptiness of Merdeka Square; everything else has been swallowed up by the sprawl of Jakarta, but the hospital still stands." />

She stood behind the counter, staring at Margaret through thick black-rimmed glasses that made her eyes look bulbous and confused. She was about fifty, no taller than Margaret but strongly built. Her scratched, fuzzy badge announced her name and position: Cantik Hartono, Senior Nurse. Sensing that Cantik’s resolve was weakening, Margaret subtly pressed home her advantage. ‘Ibu Cantik, please don’t think of us as impolite,’ she said, bowing slightly, ‘we seek only your kindness and your help.’ A whole lifetime in Asia had taught her to back off in order to get what she wanted: if you insist too strongly you will cause embarrassment, and embarrassment leads to refusal, and refusal in Asia is irreversible, for about-turns involve loss of face, tantamount to humiliation. Therefore never be too (overtly) forceful; never insist, always suggest. Read body language. Smile. Bow. Do not overreact. Be humble. Acknowledge your foreignness. These were the simple rules by which Margaret had successfully lived in Asia, and they were proving effective once more. She turned to look at Mick, who was reaching into his shirt pocket, nervously feeling for his cigarettes. She shook her head slightly and frowned; his hand fell from his chest and hung limply by his side, fingers rubbing together lightly as if playing with grains of fine sand.
	‘We are not from the Embassy, nor from a newspaper,’ Margaret said, noticing that the nurse was eyeing Mick with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. ‘The patient is someone very dear to us, and we – well, his whole family – have been suffering because we have had no news of him. He has a son – look,’ Margaret slid a photo of Adam across the smooth surface of the counter. It had been taken when he was much younger, and he looked timid and fragile, smiling nervously at the camera from underneath an enormous coolie hat. Margaret had chosen it specially from the scattered collection he had left at her house. ‘It’s his adopted son. An orphan. His name is Adam. The poor boy has no one else in the world.’
	From the drawer, the nurse pulled out a thick buff-coloured folder and began leafing through the papers inside. She paused several times and returned to documents she had already looked at, and then pulled out another folder and did the same thing. Margaret watched her trace her finger down each sheet of paper, noticing the rough leathery skin on her hands; every time the finger hesitated, pausing at a name or a line of unreadable text, Margaret felt the urge to reach over the counter and grab the folder. Every time this nurse called Cantik sighed or tutted or shook her head, Margaret thought: Oh no. She hoped Cantik would say nothing, that her finger would continue down the page and then repeat the same journey down the next one, and the next, and the next.
	‘I’m so sorry,’ Cantik said at last. ‘I don’t know what is going on. K de Willigen – that’s him, isn’t it? – well, yes, he was here. Ward 5C Intensive care. Discharged two days ago. Normally patients come out of intensive care and get moved into another ward, but he’s no longer at the hospital. It happens nowadays. Not enough beds in Jakarta, especially with all the’ – she looked around cautiously – ‘troubles going on in the country. Anyway, his medical record is missing. I don’t know why. I can’t even tell you what he was suffering from.’
	‘But you’re sure he’s not dead?’
	Cantik chewed the end of a pencil as she flicked through the last pages of another folder. ‘I have no idea, I’m sorry. You know, in this place we often get people whose records are confidential. If your friend was someone important, well…a lowly person like me wouldn’t know anything much. I just take my pay and go home.’
	‘He wasn’t really very important,’ said Margaret. Part of her felt an unusual relief at the lack of answers, for she knew that the answers were not likely to be comforting. She had become sentimental and cowardly, she thought, just like everyone else: afraid to confront pain, preferring to delay it instead. And yet another part of her felt cheated, frustrated. She hated this feeling of being thwarted, and so she stood at the counter, caught between these two conflicting sensations: should she retreat into a cloud of uncertainty or push on with her quest?
	‘I know who can help you,’ Cantik said, looking at her notebook. ‘Dr Hendro. He was on duty in the intensive care ward two nights ago. I can call him, if you want.’
	‘No, really, Ibu Cantik,’ Margaret said, ‘that won’t be necessary. We don’t want to take up any more of your time.’" />

	The man turned around but did not make any movement towards them. He did not look like a doctor: he wore nice brown trousers and a check cowboy shirt, and his glasses were shaded, not quite dark enough to be sunglasses but not clear either. Margaret could barely make out the shape of his eyes.
	‘Yes?’ he said. He had a rich voice that seemed too old and elegant for his long-limbed, gawky body.
	‘We’re, um, we’re looking for a patient you might have seen recently,’ Margaret explained. As she elaborated, the doctor shuffled towards them and went behind the counter as if taking up a defensive position. He flicked absently through Cantik’s folders and shook his head before Margaret had finished.
	‘No longer here,’ he said, his voice becoming even more magisterial. ‘I remember him. Dysentery, dehydration. Suspected septicaemia. Quite common amongst white people – as you know.’ He looked at Margaret and Mick with an expression of mild amusement (perhaps even contempt, thought Margaret, and she didn’t believe she was wrong); he wore a thin smile. ‘He asked me if he could be discharged. We don’t keep patients here against their will, you know. We live in a free country now.’
	‘You let him go, even though he was dying?’ Margaret said, trying hard to remember her rules of engagement (Do Not Lose Temper, etc).
	‘If a patient no longer wishes to be treated, that is not our problem. There are five hundred people waiting for each bed in this hospital, so if someone is ungrateful for all the things Indonesia has done for them and wants to leave, we say, Please go.’
	‘You obviously haven’t heard of the Hippocratic oath here.’ Margaret felt Mick’s hand on her elbow, exerting the faintest pressure. ‘How could you let a dying man out onto the streets? You say he had a blood infection – how could you stand by and do nothing?’
	The young doctor smiled. ‘I want to ask you something. Have you ever seen a pregnant thirteen-year-old girl dying in childbirth because she is malnourished and doesn’t have enough strength in her body to keep herself alive after giving life to her baby? What about boys of eight or nine who have arms chopped off in wars with their Christian neighbours, or grandmothers whose families try to poison them because they don’t have enough money to feed them, only the poison doesn’t work, or isn’t strong enough, and they have to come into hospital? I see these things every day here. Every day. So, one white guy with a bad stomach isn’t going to give me sleepless nights.’
	‘A dying man is a dying man,’ Margaret said, and felt the tug of Mick’s hand again, more insistent this time.
	The doctor shrugged and made a cursory effort to flick through the papers again. ‘As I said, not my problem. Anyway, he was admitted under army rules. I don’t get mixed up in all that. I just treat them while they are here. I think, however,’ he paused and smiled, ‘I think there are special rules for Dutch people. Maybe he has been repatriated. I honestly don’t know what happened to him. I came in the day before yesterday and he was no longer in the ward.’" />

I could have wrung his neck,’ said Margaret. ‘What has become of this country? Why can’t we get anything done any more? It’s just so frustrating, Mick.’
	Mick shrugged as he reversed onto the cracked bitumen in front of the hospital. A hundred years ago they would have been in a carriage, Margaret thought; she would have been dressed in a fluffy high-collared dress under the same unforgiving sun. She wondered which world she would have preferred living in: that lost world of the past in which she would have been powerful but despised by the locals, or this one, where she was completely powerless and only slightly less despised. She thought of the young doctor in his fashionable shirt and sunglasses, his cold, hard sneer. Maybe the past was a better place to live after all.
	‘For as long as I’ve been here, Indonesia has been like this,’ Mick said, navigating the car through the ranks of scooters and bicycles. The car kicked up a cloud of fine dust as it crawled along. ‘You know better than anyone how this place works.’
	‘It hasn’t always been like this. I remember a time when the people were…well, everything was just easier.’
	‘But that was an eternity ago, before…’
	‘Before what?’

She was clutching something in her hand – a white ball that turned out to be paper. She thrust it at Margaret through the open window, presenting it as if it were something rare and wonderful. ‘Sometimes patients leave things behind – when they die, for example, and no one comes and claims them. We put all these items in a box and most of the time we forget about them. Anyway, after you left I said to myself, Hey, why don’t I look in the box, just in case? There was almost nothing in it. To be honest, the people who work in the hospital, they take things. They figure no one’s going to come back for them, so why not? But at the bottom of the box I found this, and I remembered the photo you showed me of your friend’s son. I remembered his name.’ She looked pleased with herself, even though she was squinting in the harsh white sunlight.
	The cheap, almost translucent paper, so common in Jakarta, had been wadded into a tight ball which Cantik had only partially uncrumpled, and Margaret carefully teased the crushed sheets apart. They clung to each other with the brittleness of the autumn leaves she remembered from her years in America. The first few sheets she extracted were blank, marked only by deep, already yellowing creases. Only one sheet bore any words – elegant handwriting, the letters slanting forward and curling like the crests of waves. The first line read, ‘To my dear Adam…’" />

Tiny shards of grit and sand worked their way into Adam’s shoes. Somewhere in a cluster of shacks by the road a radio was playing a pretty, light-hearted keroncong tune, the soprano voice tinkling in the air like splinters of glass. Adam thought he had heard it somewhere before, on Perdo, a long time ago. Din began whistling the tune as he walked; there was a spring in his step, and he seemed bright and full of energy, speaking without any of the previous days’ vitriol.
	‘We’re really not far from the coast now. Afterwards, once we’ve done what we need to do, maybe we’ll go and look at the ships at Sunda Kelapa. You know, those big colourful boats with huge sails. Hey, I can smell the sea – can you?’
	Adam nodded weakly. He could not, in fact, smell the sea; all he could discern was the faintest tinge of moisture in the arid breeze, but otherwise there was nothing but the sour, ever-present stench of rotting garbage and kerosene.
	‘Thing is,’ Din continued, ‘we forget that Malaysia is just over there. If we wanted to, we could almost swim there! It’s really part of Indonesia – we could annex it so easily.’ He stretched out his arm and pointed at some unknown point in the distance, as if he could reach out and touch that country called Malaysia. ‘That’s where your brother is,’ he said.
	The road became gravelly, the tiny pebbles underfoot crunched loudly.
	‘You said you couldn’t remember much about your brother,’ Din continued, his voice softening, becoming almost fatherly, the way it had when he met Adam that first day.
	‘I try all the time.’ Adam felt he could speak freely now; they were so far from Margaret or Karl or anyone else Adam knew that it did not seem to matter what he said. ‘But nothing comes back. Just the basics – he was older and bigger than me, and I have a vague memory that he was brave. And then he went away. I know that, but I can’t remember it.’
	‘You were very close, weren’t you?’
	Adam nodded. He did not know how he knew this – he just did. ‘I get so angry with myself when I can’t remember anything. I try and think of him, but nothing comes back. I hate myself. I’m useless.’
	‘No you’re not,’ said Din, putting an arm round Adam’s shoulders. ‘It’s quite common, even normal. You must have suffered some sort of trauma which your brain has blocked out.’ He sounded authoritative and entirely certain, as if expounding a scientific theory.
	‘But I can’t remember any trauma.’
	‘That’s the point. The brain is a very complex thing. When a human being suffers great emotional or physical pain, sometimes the only way to deal with it is to forget it altogether. You can’t control this – the brain does it by itself, a kind of selective amnesia. You do know what amnesia is, I presume. Anyway, the brain creates a void in the memory. Other things associated with the pain might remain – noises or smells or visual recollections – but the pain itself is removed. The problem is that a lot of other valuable stuff is sometimes dragged into the void too.’
	Adam thought of the sounds and images that came to him from time to time. Din was right; everything made sense. It was as if all his life he had been standing in a room lit by electric lamps and suddenly someone had thrown open the windows and let in daylight. ‘I must be a freak,’ he said.
	‘Not at all. There are plenty of case studies that document the same thing. For example, I once went to a village in Sulawesi. I had a scholarship then and it was part of my so-called research – ha! Anyway, in this village there had been a bloody war between Muslims and Christians a generation before, but now the sons and daughters of the people who had butchered one another were living side by side again. The only way they could do this was by blocking out the pain. But wait, this is the weird part. There was hardly any noise in this village, no loud voices or arguments or laughter. Everyone walked about in a daze, as if they were daydreaming. It was as if their whole beings were devoted to suppressing their memories. Their brains had erased too much.’
	‘I’m not that bad, am I?’ Adam said, trying to laugh. ‘I’m not a zombie.’
	‘No, of course not. We all suffer from it in one way or another. Erasing memories in this semi-conscious way goes on everywhere, on a national scale, with culture – everything. We Asians are very good at it. If there’s a drought that kills hundreds of thousands, or an earthquake, or the government fires upon demonstrators – well, we just forget it and move on. It lingers in our psyche, but we never let it come to the surface. It just stays buried deep inside. When I lived in Europe I saw that Westerners remember everything – they commemorate bad things that happened to them. It was the only thing I liked about the West.’" />

It’s as if you’re floating aimlessly in the sea, being dragged every which way by currents and waves. You get pulled underwater: there’s nothing there. No people, no trees, no air to breathe. It’s another world, a place your body occupies but where you don’t really exist. So what’s the problem? you ask. You’re here, aren’t you? As long as you’re not dead, it’s OK. Well, look around you, look at those babies sitting by the road, staring into space. Life has just begun for them, and already it is empty. Is that really better than death? Do you think they’re poor but happy? Those kids back there, begging, selling their bodies for a few rupiah – they don’t know what their history is. Our history.

	‘You’re right,’ said Adam.
	Din began to whistle the keroncong tune again. He looked pensive, as if mulling over something that had just occurred to him. After a while he said, ‘Don’t worry, I will help you find your brother. You must reclaim your past. I promise I will help you, Adam.’
	‘And you,’ Adam said, ‘do you know what your past is?’

Two old men sat on a wooden bench; on the dirt before them they had laid out a few things for sale: a carton of Winstons and a few bottles of honey-coloured Benzine. They nodded at Din, their sun-scarred faces livened for an instant by faint smiles. Din stopped in front of a sheet of zinc; pasted onto it were old advertisements for soft drinks and cigarettes, flaking away in the heat to reveal layers of even older posters. It was only when Din began to undo a heavy padlock that Adam realised that the collage of posters was a door to a shack so dilapidated it seemed to disappear into the shadows of the houses that flanked it. There was a flutter of tiny wings; nesting swifts, disturbed from their peaceful roosts, escaped from the deep gloom through the holes in the roof. Pools of light made nearly-white circles on the dirt floor, but nonetheless it took Adam a few moments to make out what was in the shed: stacks of timber, damp and edged with crinkly mould; old worn tyres piled up at the far end of the long, narrow space; a few bicycle frames hanging from the walls, stripped of their wheels, chains and pedals, like skeletons of a strange creature. Din unfurled a length of tarpaulin and began to remove planks of wood; all the while he continued to whistle the same bright melody they had heard earlier, and it made Adam think of Perdo, of his house with its solid floors and solid roof that did not have any holes in it. He began to feel a sudden welling up of the bitter sickness that he had become all too familiar with in recent days.
	‘Come help me,’ Din said, tugging at a thick length of timber and sliding it towards Adam. It was rotting and splintered, and when Adam touched it he had to resist the urge to recoil from it. Together they moved all the wood until they had cleared a space, and it was then that Adam noticed an old tin chest that must once have been used to transport tea or spices from island to island. When Din opened it, Adam saw a tangle of wires and a few jars of pale yellow liquid, heaped together with some metal rods, an empty Bintang bottle (with part of its label scratched off), a child’s doll with Western features and other things that Adam did not recognise. It looked like a fisherman’s net cast carelessly across a wash of flotsam.
	Din delved into the contents of the chest and emerged with a canvas satchel which he slung immediately over his shoulders so that the strap sat across his chest, the small pouch resting safely against his hip. He put a hand on it, adjusting it minutely, as though reacquainting himself with something old and familiar and comforting. ‘Good,’ he said, and smiled; he was standing on the edge of a column of sunlight that flooded in through the patched-up roof; the light caught the side of his face, harshly illuminating half his smile while leaving the rest in the shadows. He held up the old bottle of Bintang." />

No “Doctor” before my name, just plain old Din, no different from one hundred million people around me. All I had was the last of my guilders in my pocket. I went to a Chinese place in Glodok and drank five bottles of beer, one after another. I’d never touched alcohol before. I can remember the streets feeling very long and uncertain as I made my way home; in the becak I felt as if I were slipping downstream in a boat on a big muddy river, like the Musi that I remembered from my childhood. I didn’t feel happy, but I wasn’t depressed either. It was just this feeling of in-betweenness, where it seems everything’s possible yet you can’t control anything. One day you might experience it, but I hope not. It was frustrating. Even when I fell asleep, I wasn’t really asleep. I closed my eyes and I could still see the ceiling spinning. When I woke up I felt the worst I have ever felt, as if my body had been poisoned and rotted to the bone. I swore I would never drink alcohol again, and I never have. I keep the bottle to remind me of what I did.’ He was staring intently at the bottle as though he had been addressing it rather than Adam, and was now waiting for it to respond.
	‘Oh well,’ he said at last. ‘It’s only an empty bottle.’ And he threw it hard past Adam against a stack of timber at the back of the shed. It hit the wood with a dull thud and did not shatter but merely broke undramatically into three or four neat pieces that fell onto the dirt floor.

Adam wished Din would stop, for it made him think of that place by the sea which was no longer his home.
	At a crossroads they came upon barricades that held the traffic at a standstill. The perpendicular avenue was empty, a ghost-town in the middle of the metropolis. Adam and Din stopped amid a throng of pedestrians at the barriers, straining to see the convoy streaming towards them: five or six magnificent black cars, some bearing a fluttering flag on their bonnet. Adam did not know that such cars existed in Indonesia; or, indeed, that they existed at all. They swept past the crowd in an instant, and a few moments later, when they were nearly out of sight, the soldiers removed the barricades, and the cars and scooters and bicycles recommenced their laboured journey. As they went past the soldiers, Din put his arm around Adam’s shoulders. ‘One day, you might be an important person – like those guys in the cars,’ he said. He drew Adam close to him, as an older brother might a younger brother, and Adam felt the satchel between them, bulky and hard and uncomfortable.
	No trees lined the road. Adam could see no vegetation or foliage, just a forest of concrete structures built in fantastic shapes conceived in a dream. He was tired from the walking, he was tired of this city. It was not at all like the city he had once constructed in his imagination. He could barely remember that invisible world he had once known so intimately, a place full of love and possibility and promise. Walking along this interminable road, his ribs were beginning to hurt again, and the emptiness in his stomach reminded him once again that he was just like the millions of other people around him.
	‘It feels strange, knowing that I’m going to look for my brother after all these years. I never thought I could talk about it, or even think about it,’ said Adam. Contemplating this new future seemed the only way to alleviate the pain in his ribs and the sharp bite of blisters that were beginning to form on his heel and big toe. ‘In a way, I’m glad I can’t remember anything about him. That way I won’t be disappointed.’
	‘Of course you won’t be disappointed. You’ll find your brother because that’s your only choice in life – and I’ll be there to help you, don’t you worry.’ Din spoke with the same generosity as earlier, but he sounded brisker now, more distracted, as if he did not really wish to converse. Maybe he, too, was tired.
	At last they approached a roundabout built around a perfectly circular pool of water; it was so wide that Adam could not make out the faces of the pedestrians on the far side. In the middle of the pool there was a fountain, and a statue of a boy and girl holding hands on top of a giant plinth. In the streets there were clusters of soldiers everywhere, on foot and in trucks, chatting calmly amongst themselves, or smoking cigarettes. Adam and Din walked past a group of half a dozen of them manning a barbed-wire barricade in front of a badly burnt building. One of them threw his head back in laughter as his colleague told a joke (Adam heard something about ‘a buffalo’ and ‘wife’ as he walked past) and in his black sunglasses Adam saw the reflection of ochre-coloured clouds. These soldiers were older and more strongly-built than the ones who had taken Karl away, thought Adam. They looked calm, even relaxed, but there was a tenseness in the way they held their guns, slung tautly from their necks, the butts cradled in their biceps.
	‘Are you admiring the Victory Monument?’ Din asked, pointing at the statue of the blissfully innocent children above the fountain; frozen in full stride, they looked as if they were about to step off their platform and fall into the shallow water below. As they passed another group of soldiers, Din put his arm around Adam’s shoulders once again. ‘Bet you don’t have great monuments like this where you come from, out in the islands,’ he continued loudly. ‘Come on, you’re impressed, aren’t you? Don’t try and act cool. This is a symbol of modern Indonesia!’ He was still smiling, but as he continued Adam noticed the change in his voice, as if he were trying to conceal or suppress something. It took Adam a while to work out what this thing was: fear. He recognised it because it was something he had grown to know intimately over the last few days. He recognised it because, quite suddenly, he too felt a quick, inexplicable shiver of fear rush through him.
	‘But in fact we have just passed the truest face of revolutionary Indonesia,’ Din said as they made their way to the far side of the roundabout. ‘The burning of the British Embassy – that is what the revolution is really about.’
	‘Look,’ Adam said as they approached a majestic modern building, ‘there are the cars we saw earlier.’ A rank of gleaming black cars stood waiting on the ramp leading to the building – many more than just the five or six they had seen before. ‘What is this place? It’s amazing. Is it the President’s Palace?’ he asked.
	Din laughed – a cold, hard sneering laugh. ‘That’s the symbol of all that is wrong with our world today. It is the palace of corruption and hedonism and injustice and every other evil you can think of – so, yes, I suppose you could say it’s the President’s Palace. That’s very clever of you, my little orphan. You see, I was right all along: you are a revolutionary at heart.’
	They seemed to be walking past it, away from the great roundabout, into the dusty side streets where the buildings were lower and more modest. Adam looked back at the palace, admiring its perfect angular construction. He knew, of course, that it was not a real palace, but it comforted him to think of it as such. He liked the way it looked solid, permanent and comfortable, unlike the tin-and-timber shacks in which he had passed the last few nights. He also knew that it was a place in which he would not be welcome. Not so long ago, with Karl to look after him, he might have felt perfectly at ease in a place like that. But that was his Past Life. In this, his Present Life, he belonged to the other side, the side of the nameless and hungry who walked the dusty streets looking up at the great buildings and shiny cars of this great city, trying to imagine what kind of people might inhabit that world.
	They stopped in the shade of a concrete shelter surrounded by giant rusty bins, emptied of their contents; the sweet stench of rubbish lingered in the air. Din reached into his satchel and took out a packet of 555s. ‘I didn’t know you smoked,’ Adam said.
	‘I don’t,’ Din replied, striking a match and lifting it hesitantly to the cigarette he had placed between his lips. His hand was trembling, Adam noticed, the flame refusing to settle on the stubby point of the cigarette. When he spoke, Adam could barely make out his narrowed eyes through the cloud of smoke. ‘Now, this is the moment I need you to help me. Inside this palace of sin there are many people, many important people, many foreigners. These foreigners are intent on wrecking the great Indonesian revolution by paying corrupt officials to sacrifice the future of the Indonesian people – good, ordinary folk like you and me. A party is about to begin, a celebration of all the things that are wrong with our country. In an hour, even the President will be there.’
	‘How can I help you?’ Adam felt the quick chill of fear run through him again, more violently this time.
	Din lifted the satchel from his shoulder and put it over Adam’s – slowly, as if it were a garland. And now Adam felt the dead weight of it against his own hips, bulkier even than before. ‘Just take this into the building. Make your way to the men’s toilet at the far end of the lobby, just beyond the place called the Batik Bar. The Batik Bar, got that? Go to the furthest cubicle, and leave the satchel beside the toilet. Just leave it there. I have been there before, and it’s simple. If you lose your way, just ask for directions. Be confident. You’re not doing anything wrong, I assure you – you’re just being a true, responsible Indonesian revolutionary. Remember the President’s speech, when he said he loved revolutionaries? Well, you’re just one of us, doing your duty. You’re one of us now, my friend, one of us.’ He dropped his barely smoked cigarette before grasping Adam’s shoulders with both hands and squeezing him gently. He wore an expression that spoke at once of tenderness and fervour and belief, and Adam thought, I really am his friend, I mean something to him. Adam nodded; Din’s declaration of friendship made him feel less afraid. Din had helped him, and was going to help him find his brother. Adam had to repay him.
	‘What will happen once I leave the satchel?’ he asked.
	‘Nothing,’ Din said. ‘Once it’s there, you just turn around and walk straight back out as if nothing’s happened. Our revolutionary friends who work in the building will do the rest, and I will wait for you right here.’
	‘What’s in here?’ Adam asked, feeling the straps of the satchel lightly with his fingers; part of him did not want to know the answer.
	‘That’s not important,’ Din said with sudden alarm. ‘Do not open it. Just leave it in the toilets as I instructed you. Don’t think too much about what you have to do – it’ll be over in a few minutes.’
	‘Can I ask you, Din,’ he began before hesitating. ‘Why me? Why do you trust me to help you?’
	Din smiled and shrugged. ‘Because, well, let’s just say it’s the way you look. When you go up there, you will see. There will be people manning the doors, unfriendly people. They would never let someone like me in. But you – look at you, your nice shirt and trousers and hair. As soon as I saw you, I knew you were perfect for the job. You look like a decent boy from a nice family – even though you are one of us now.’ He looked at his watch quickly. ‘OK, my little orphan, it’s time to go.’
	‘What is this place, really?’ Adam said as he began to move away.
	‘It’s a hotel. The Hotel Java.’
	As Adam turned and retraced his steps towards the front of the building, he heard Din striking a match that stubbornly refused to light; he was whistling the same tune he had been whistling all day long. ‘Remember,’ he called out to Adam, ‘just relax. Be yourself, little orphan boy. I know you will be fine. Come back quickly.’" />

Adam walked up the long curving ramp that led to the lobby. He caught a glimpse of his reflection in the darkened windows of the big black cars that lined the ramp; he looked older, he thought, older and sadder. It was not just his face but the way he carried himself – the hunching of his shoulders, the tired shuffling walk – that showed how his life had changed in such a small space of time. He ran his fingers through his hair, hoping it would make him look neater. He remembered Din’s instructions and tried not to think about his simple task; he tried not to think about the satchel that chafed against his hip. Instead, he tried to focus on the future he would have with his brother; he tried to imagine the years of contentment that would stretch out before them: life waiting to be lived. But he could not conjure up this joy. That imagined future eluded him, wriggling away from his grasp, just as his past happiness had abandoned him.
	Finally he saw the beautiful glass doors that led into the lobby; their smooth clean surfaces reflecting images of the city: the tops of buildings, the ragged leaves of a palm tree, a bit of sky. The doors opened and closed slowly, like something in a dream." />

Most of the men were local. There were very few Europeans now, compared to before. There were palm trees in pots and framed sepia photos of cricket and rugger teams on the walls. In the middle of the room an Indian bartender was mopping up a spilt drink on the black-and-white chequered floor. There were no women in this place.
	Put down the paper and talk to me like a man, Johan.
	OK. He could not fold the paper properly. He had turned it inside out and now the insides were showing on the outside. He had drunk a long drink and he felt sick. His father had ordered it for him, something called a Gunner. He felt sick and he needed to urinate.
	You’re a big boy now, Johan, a big strong good-looking fellah, but you know what? You’re still a mummy’s boy. Nearly a man, yet you behave like a child with no responsibilities. A spoilt, ungrateful child. What do you say to that?
	Nothing, Johan shrugged. Depends what you want me to say.
	Don’t be clever with me, young man. You better watch your mouth when you’re with me or else there’s going to be trouble. You got your poor mummy twisted round your little finger, but I’m smarter than that. You think you are one big-time genius, but one day you will learn.
	Johan did not answer. They sat on a long deep veranda, and beyond them there was an expanse of immaculate lawn. In the dark it looked blank, limitless. It could have been anything, anywhere. Like the sea, Johan thought, it was like the sea. He felt sick and he needed the toilet.
	Here you are, you young people. You don’t know how bloody lucky you are. Just merry-go-round all day having a gala time. When I was your age, I tell you, I was already working three jobs at once. No schooling, no Dickens and algebra like you buggers, and yet look at me now. Life gave me nothing and yet here I am. Self-made. Everything I have, I earned with my two bare hands. You drive around in my fancy car, think I don’t know? Where do you think the money to buy that car came from? From Mars? Ya, you people don’t know a thing about hard work.
	We don’t know a thing about corruption either.
	What’s that supposed to mean? I can’t understand what you’re saying, young man. Your mummy says you’re so clever and so shy, that’s why we can’t understand you. You barely speak, and when you do, you just talk in riddles, and I ask myself, is it because you’re clever and I’m stupid? Bullshit, of course not. It’s because there’s so much twisted rubbish going on in that handsome little head of yours. Maybe I spoiled the three of you too much. Ya, it’s my fault. Mine and Mummy’s. Nice toys, nice clothes, holidays here, there, everywhere. You guys have no idea of the value of money.
	Yes we do. We know you have to earn it in proper ways, not abuse your position and take advantage of other people. Johan got out of his chair and went to the edge of the veranda. There was a low wide balustrade and he placed his hands on it, leaning over the side to look down at the dark empty space below. His eyes took a while to get used to the absence of light. And then he saw figures, shadows moving in the dark, silently, as though they were not connected to the ground. They would come together and drift apart again, here and there across the wide expanse of the playing fields. There was no wind in this city and he felt ill. He imagined himself in the car, driving at speed with the windows open, and the thought of it made him feel better.
	Don’t listen to gossip, Johan.
	I don’t. I can make up my own mind. I know what you do. And I don’t care. He continued to gaze at the shadowy figures drifting in the dark. He liked the dark. He wished he were there, in that black space." />

	There was a sound of breaking glass, something shattering on the cold hard floor, followed by robust laughter.
	Johan thought about his brother and sister. Bob and Farah. They were not his brother and sister, he could not think of them in this way. He did not care about Bob. But Farah – he did not want to cause problems for her.
	You make a lot of trouble for me, Johan. You drive around town at night going to all these bad places, smoking and drinking. What’s more, I hear you’re going around with a girl. A prostitute some more. What kind of good Muslim boy does things like that? Don’t forget I have an important position, you know. People see you, people talk: There goes Halim’s son again with that prostitute. You bring shame on the family. I pray to god your mother doesn’t hear these things.
	I’m not the only one bringing shame. Anyway, don’t listen to gossip, as you say.
	Celaka. You are really too much. No respect at all. Enough nonsense, Johan, I have a proposal. That’s why I wanted to have a drink with you tonight, a drink and a chat, man to man, father to son.
	Yes, father to son.
	Don’t start that.
	OK, Daddy.
	I think you need to be taught how to behave responsibly. You need to snap out of this stupid existence you have. You can’t spend all your life being reckless and inconsiderate. Think about your poor mummy. So I have made plans for you. You’re going to be enrolled at the RMC.
	I can’t. It’s too late. You can’t get into Military College, you have to do stuff, tests and other things. I know people who’ve been trying for months.
	Don’t worry, it’s all settled. Ya, I called my friend – you know, Uncle Zam. He’s just been made a general. Brilliant fellah, went to Cambridge. No problem, he said, he can fix it. I told Uncle Zam, There’s hope for my kid but we really need to be harsh on him, really beat him into shape. He’s a wild kid, I said, but no one’s beyond control. This kind of kid, all they need is a bit of discipline. So you’re going to start in a few weeks, Johan.

	Aduh. His father sighed. What to do with you, Johan? Maybe it’s my fault, after all. But Uncle Zam said, Don’t worry, Military College will straighten him out. Don’t be hard on yourself, Halim, he told me, it’s because of the boy’s genes, no one can help him.
	What?
	Well, your, let’s say, background. Being honest, it comes down to genes. Everyone knows Indonesians are a wild bunch. They’re not really the same as us. We just have to acknowledge that.
	Being honest, you’ve never loved me. You never wanted me in the first place, did you, Daddy?.
	How can you say that? Who told you that? Did Bob say that? Did he tell you that? I’ll whack that fellah. Bloody big fat mouth.
	No. I just know. Only Mummy wanted me. You didn’t want some Indonesian orphan from the street, you wanted your own son, like Bob. I understand.
	Why are you so ungrateful, Johan? I can’t believe it, after all that we’ve done for you. Think about what might have happened to you if Mummy and I hadn’t picked you out of that shitty place and brought you over here. You’d still be living in the longkang with the rest of the orphans, no clothes, no books, no home, no future, just like your – I mean, like the others.
	Like my brother, you mean.
	Johan, no. Stop. We told you a long time ago, as soon as you were old enough to understand. You have to face the truth. Your brother is dead. How many times have we told you that? Nothing can change that. Your life is here, in this place, you mustn’t think of the orphanage. That is long gone. It is another world.
	I wish you’d left me there, Johan wanted to say. I wish you had left me and taken my brother. He would have made a good son for you. He would have loved and respected you because he was full of love, and he needed to be loved. Johan had wanted to say this all his life, he had waited for the right moment to say it, but now that the moment had arrived, he could not find the breath to say it. He felt sick and he still needed the toilet.
	OK, I have to go now. I have to go to dinner. Can’t waste any more time with this. Just drop me off, then you can take the car. At least you won’t have to steal it.
	They walked the length of the veranda, past men dressed in nice batik shirts sitting down to their dinners of chicken chops and oxtail soup. There was still no breeze in the night but Johan felt less sick. In a moment he would be in the car, moving again.
	You’re right, Daddy, my place is here. This is my home. He tried to believe what he had just said, but he could not.
	In the heavy shadows of the lane beyond the car park there were more shadows. Someone whistled at them from the dark, a high-pitched catcall.
	Finally talking sense, young man. Where else do you want to go? Better stay put and make your mummy happy.
	There’s nowhere else for me to go.
	That’s right. Just swallow some pride once in a while. You’ll enjoy RMC. It will be very good for you, you’ll see.

	And yet some things eluded her. She had not really been able to grasp the concept of children – why people felt the need to bring new life into the world, for it seemed to her something not just illogical but counter-intuitive: why sacrifice your life to something that is almost certainly going to turn out to be imperfect, something you will never be able to control? Why on earth had her parents decided to have her when they knew they would never be able to provide her with proper parenting? Even now, at the age of forty-two, she had not yet figured it out.

	Margaret smiled. In her hands she held five sheets of thin crinkled paper, smoothing them with her fingers in the hope that the creases would disappear. She looked at the first sheet, at the lines of cursive handwriting that scrolled across the page; it was the kind of handwriting that seemed to emerge from a lost, earlier world, one in which typewriters and cheap newsprint did not exist. The letters were slightly spidery, the writer’s hand shaky, unsure. Most of the lines had been crossed out, though not thoroughly enough to obscure the words that lay underneath. It was not as if the writer had wanted to hide what he had written, Margaret thought, but rather to rehearse what he wanted to say. She reread the lines that had been struck through:

	Before I die
	Ten years ago, when you were six When you were six I vowed promised

	To my dear Adam

	The other four sheets of paper were blank, clinging to the first sheet with what Margaret considered a sort of desperation, as if they, too, wanted to be filled with deletions.
	When the nurse called Cantik had given her those scrunched-up bits of paper, she had allowed herself to think that this tangible link with Karl meant that he was still alive, still waiting for her to find him in this city. You can never predict what Life is going to serve up. Always expect surprises. She tried to recall the times in her life when simply repeating phrases like these could cheer her up, when she could trick herself into believing that nothing was ever beyond salvation; and once set on the right path she could make things happen by the sheer force of her will, turn a hopeless situation into at least something acceptable. It seemed such a recent thing, this blind confidence of youth, but now she had lost it – and she knew it was gone for good. What was worse, it had been replaced by an over-developed appreciation of reality, which now told her that she would never see Karl again.
	‘You’re right, Mick,’ she said, ‘we just need to find Adam and take him back to his home, make sure he’s all right. If Karl’s not there, we’ll find him somewhere else to live. Maybe,’ she paused, ‘maybe he could come and live with me.’
	‘You seem to like him a lot. I’ve never seen you so motherly.’
	‘I loathe that word,’ she chuckled. ‘I mean, look at me. I couldn’t be Mummy if I tried. But there’s something about Adam that I understand – I don’t know what it is, I just feel I know what’s going through his head.’
	‘Let’s just see what happens. We might find his father, in which case it’ll be happy families all round.’
	Margaret turned away from Mick. The highway in front of them dipped and curved slightly and offered a view of a shantytown, the tin roofs of the houses melding together to form a plain of rust and corroded metal. ‘I think we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, Mick. I have a feeling Karl’s not coming back.’" />

Sometimes they railed against the neo-dictators (meaning their teachers), sometimes against America and Britain, other times against the corrupt politicians, but mostly it was just the standard Ganyang Malaysia. Crush crush crush Malaysia, the chants would repeat tediously, and even the protestors themselves would seem bored. Today, however, the crowd was very large, two hundred or more, and relatively calm.

There was a cohesion in the way the students raised their fists to cheer every crescendo in the speaker’s voice, a sense of purpose that Margaret had seldom witnessed at these campus protests. Through the steady murmur of voices and the crackling static of the loudspeaker, Margaret discerned the words ‘…and so becomes dark, rotten, evil to the very core’. The woman’s voice was dramatic and clear, the emphasis on each word perfectly judged, like the formal speech of a lenong play. Margaret strained to hear more, but the words were drowned in a chorus of cheers and whistles.
	‘Do you see Din?’ Mick asked, slowing down as they skirted the fringes of the demonstration.
	‘No,’ Margaret said. ‘He might be in the crowd, of course, but he’s not with those guys standing up by the podium. Those are the members of the student council. Let’s drive round the back. There’s another entrance further along where there won’t be anyone and we can leave the car. I don’t think it’s a good idea to fling ourselves into the midst of this mob.’
	‘Agreed. Students are the most dangerous ones nowadays.’
	Margaret looked back at the young woman who had been speaking. She was stepping down from the podium to raucous applause, shaking hands with a slim, long-haired boy. ‘She looks like a ringleader,’ Margaret said. ‘That’s who we need to speak to.’
	They left the car and walked across the badminton courts; the smooth concrete surface was marked by cracks where tree roots were forcing their way slowly to the surface. Overhead the spreading acacias were shedding their leaves at the end of the long hot season, scattering their tawny confetti across the shady court. There were pieces of paper too, hundreds of leaflets urging hundreds of different things. Every day there were students handing out these flyers, but Margaret was never sure if anyone read them; they lay trodden into the dirt, bleached to a crust by the sun. Along some of the walkways outside the classrooms there was broken glass, and many of the panes from the louvred windows were missing." />

The glass had broken very easily, as though made of thin, crumbly plaster. It had exploded into a million tiny shards that refracted the sunlight – balls of brilliant colour that exploded into existence for a second, like those magical bursts of fireworks that light up for a moment before suddenly disappearing, leaving you staring at nothingness." />

Margaret and Mick made their way up to Margaret’s office, past a makeshift barricade of desks and chairs with a piece of paper pinned to it. REVOLUTIONARIES ONLY PAST THIS POINT, it proclaimed in shaky handwriting; it reminded her of a child’s den, a tree house that had fallen to the ground.
	‘That’s weird,’ Margaret said when she got to the door. ‘I can’t get it open. My key isn’t working – the lock seems to be jammed.’
	Mick wiggled the key, teasing the handle at the same time. He leaned a shoulder against the door, pushing his weight against it. Margaret noticed how heavy he had become. He had always been sturdily built, even as a young man, but now he was properly thickset. His hands, however, worked with a delicacy that was not in keeping with the bulkiness of his frame. ‘Someone’s been tampering with the lock. Don’t worry, it’ll give, it’s only a flimsy thing. And it’s not really broken.’ He pulled the door towards him, and with a gentle twist eased the door open.
	Margaret’s desk looked exactly as she had left it three days earlier. She sat in her chair and surveyed the mounds of paper and books: all in order. There were notes, too, from various students, as well as political leaflets. Instinctively she reached for the bottom right-hand drawer, just below her knee; she found the key, hidden in the thin ledge on the underside of the pedestal, and when she unlocked the drawer she was comforted to see the same buff-coloured folder that had been there for many years, on its cover the words: ‘Tchambuli: Kinship and Understanding in Northern Papua New Guinea.’ Her passport, too, lay nestled between the folder and the side of the drawer, its pages opening just enough to reveal the dollar bills folded inside. It had been a long time since she had seen either of those things; they seemed foreign, unreal – things that belonged to someone else. She considered taking them with her. But then she closed the drawer and locked it, returning the key to its hiding place. Somehow these two items – which amounted to a mere jumble of paper – seemed safer here, where they had always been. In spite of the riots outside, she trusted her office and the university more than she did her house.
	Din’s desk, however, had been stripped clean. The low shelves behind the desk were bare except for a thin trail of ants snaking their way into a tiny fissure in the wall." />

Mick began looking through the drawers but found only bits of string and a few elastic bands.
	‘Nope, no clues whatsoever,’ he said, running his hand under the desk, ‘it’s completely clean. Not even a porn mag taped to the inside. Is it normal for people to disappear like this?’
	‘Students often leave without giving notice. One day they’re there, arguing with you about whether Brezhnev is a good guy, the next day they’re gone. Sometimes they’re killed in a riot or run over by a lorry, sometimes they just give up. Mostly they run out of money and are too ashamed to be seen by their friends, so they disappear into thin air. But teachers, well, that’s not so common. You normally have warning signs. And someone like Din…he’s not the kind to surrender everything like that.’
	‘Maybe there were warning signs and you just didn’t see them.’
	‘You don’t understand, Mick: he’s bright. And ambitious. What his ambitions involve, I’m less certain, but he wouldn’t just throw it all in like that. He might not have been likeable, but he was clever. He had a future. It’s possible he’s been fired, but then again, it wouldn’t be so sudden – and I would definitely have known about it.’
	‘Does anyone really have a future in this country?’ Mick asked as they left the office and made their way down to the courtyard. Margaret could not tell if he was joking.
	‘We need to talk to the people who run the student council,’ she said. ‘They’ll know where Din is – they’re all basically communists of one kind or another, even if they say they aren’t. I lose track of all the factions, and I don’t think they really know what’s going on either.

	They made their way towards the main gates, where the protestors were still gathered. They heard a steady chanting: a single word that sounded to Margaret like rhi-no-ce-ros, or perhaps someone’s name. There was a time when she would have understood these not-so-clever in-jokes, these satirical references to things that happened in daily life, but she no longer grasped what was happening. She looked at Mick, who was walking quite calmly beside her, taking care not to edge ahead, as if waiting for her to lead the way.
	‘They’re quite excitable, aren’t they?’ he said.
	‘They’re only students,’ Margaret said, marginally reassured by her own voice. This was so stupid, she thought to herself. She was apprehensive about approaching a group of students with banners and silly bits of cloth round their foreheads. She even recognised some of them: there, that one waving the stick, she’d given him private lessons in English and taught him to say, ‘Good day, how do you do?’ He was harmless. They all were. And yet the memory of the previous day’s riot was still vivid in her mind. The whiteness of her skin that stood out so completely in the sea of dark bodies, how she had been made to feel different – profoundly and utterly different – in this country for the first time in her life; her helplessness; her reliance on Bill, on other people, on chance – she could still feel all these things, and she was scared.
	They paused in a narrow corridor behind a concrete stairwell that hid them from view.
	‘Won’t this make good copy?’ Mick said, laughing. ‘I’m finally a proper foreign correspondent in the danger zone.’
	‘Let’s not get carried away. It’s hardly the Bay of Pigs.’
	Mick was just feeling for his imaginary cigarettes when someone came round the corner, walking very quickly, brushing past him.
	‘Sorry.’ It was the girl they had seen earlier on the podium. She hurried along, not pausing to look back at them. Margaret recognised her as a member of the student council; she was certain she had seen Din talking to this girl on several occasions.
	‘Miss, hello, miss, excuse me,’ Margaret called out, starting after her. The girl did not stop; she did not even turn around.
	Mick ran after the girl, catching up with her after a few (surprisingly swift) strides. ‘Excuse us,’ he said, catching her elbow. She drew away instinctively and looked up with a frown. Her eyes were dark, distracted, as if she did not understand where she was. ‘Sorry,’ she said, blinking, ‘I didn’t hear you. I’m rushing to get somewhere.’
	‘Is the protest over, then?’ Margaret said. ‘I thought it was just warming up.’
	The girl put her hand over one side of her brow to shield her eyes from the afternoon sun. The shadows that fell on her face accentuated her slim nose and shapely cheekbones. She blinked and rubbed her eye; she was very pretty, Margaret thought.
	‘Are you OK?’ Mick said.
	‘Yes, sorry,’ she said, ‘just a speck of dust.’
	‘So you are abandoning the protest early.’
	‘That?’ the girl said, looking vaguely in the direction of the main gates. ‘I don’t know how long that will last. I’ve done my speech, and now there’s something else urgent I need to attend to. I’m sorry, but I’m very late already.’ Raising her eyebrows as if to excuse herself, she pointed over her shoulder, motioning to where the bicycles were kept, and Margaret noticed a stripe on her wrist, a band of light-coloured skin that had been shielded from the sun by a wristwatch or a bracelet. Odd, thought Margaret, though she could not say exactly why she found this unusual.
	‘We were just wondering,’ Margaret said, trying to sound firm, ‘if you knew the whereabouts of Maluddin Saidi. You might simply call him Din, as I do. You know, my assistant. He’s a research student. Do you know who I’m talking about? He serves on the student council, I think.’
	The girl nodded. ‘Of course I know him. I’m sorry to tell you that Maluddin has been reported for suspected membership of extremist groups that use violence to promote their political views – if you can call such views ‘political’. Actually, I’m not sorry to tell you this. He deserves it. Those people are just idiots, if you ask me.’
	Margaret could usually tell where someone came from – their native region and level of society – but this girl was frustratingly elusive; she spoke fluently and without much of an accent. She reminded Margaret of those society girls one saw, the extravagantly dressed daughters of the burgeoning nouveau-riche, schooled in the States or Australia. At the same time, there was something of the shanties about her: the slight aggressiveness of her consonants, the confrontational way of speaking to someone in authority, the way she was nervously pulling at strands of her glossy black hair while trying to appear casual – all these things suggested to Margaret someone who belonged to the new-style socialist movement.
	‘You mean Din’s been dismissed? Just like that?’ The idea of him being locked out of his own office, kept away from his books and typewriter – all the things that were important to him, that held the key to his future – made her angry.
	‘No,’ said the girl, still squinting into the light and blinking with irritation (not because of the dust, Margaret thought, but because she was unhappy at being challenged). ‘For now he is merely suspended while the evidence against him is considered. Of course we in the council will be pushing for his swift dismissal. The longer his type has any links to well-intentioned student activists, the worse it will be for everyone.’
	‘The worse it will be for you, you mean?’ said Margaret. ‘I suppose it was you who reported Din to the authorities?’
	The girl lifted her chin slightly – a scant millimetre’s change in the way she held her head; it would have been imperceptible to anyone but Margaret. ‘Of course,’ she said. ‘It was my duty. We can’t take the risk of having someone violent in our midst. For Indonesia to progress, we need a pure, good-hearted revolution. I’m sure you agree.’
	‘You’re supposed to be his friend. I’ve seen you talking to him, laughing, having fun. I even wondered whether you were his girlfriend.’
	The girl laughed. It came out as a snort, an artificial chuckle. ‘I wonder why you are so concerned about him. Evidently you are sufficiently concerned about his private life that you have taken to spying on him. Yet you don’t know him intimately, or else you would know about his violent ideals.’
	Oh my god, thought Margaret, this girl is patronising me. Margaret could not remember the last time anyone had spoken to her in this way.
	‘Yes,’ the girl continued, ‘it’s a good idea to defend this poor clever boy from the kampung. All he wants is to finish his doctorate and help Indonesia achieve justice and fairness. By making bombs. By taking men and women from their families in the middle of the night and making sure they never return.’
	Mick cleared his throat and bear-laughed heartily. ‘That’s not what Margaret meant, was it, Margaret?’
	Margaret did not answer. She tried to hold the girl’s gaze but was unnerved by the coldness of the nearly black pupils that stared back at her without flinching. The girl had stopped blinking, but her eyes were still red and moist, irritated by that speck of dust; it was as though she wanted to prove how easily she could withstand something that bothered her, how she could control her reflexes. It was something Asian women seemed to be able to do so easily, something Margaret had always been able to imitate; but now she could no longer do so. She knew she was displaying signs of irritation. Do not get flustered, Margaret Bates, do not back down.
	‘What’s your name?’ Margaret asked, trying to sound calm.
	‘Zubaidah,’ the girl said. ‘Most people know me as Z. It’s a nickname my parents gave me.’ Her reply was even calmer than Margaret’s question.
	‘Ah, yes, Z of the famous revolutionary pamphlet. Hello, Z. I didn’t think you would be quite so innocent-looking. I’d expected someone rougher.’
	‘That’s because you’re full of prejudices. I’m sorry, but I really am very late,’ Z said, lifting her arm and turning her wrist in an instinctive motion; but there was no wristwatch there, and she looked up at Margaret again. ‘I don’t have time to stand around discussing this.’
	‘Z. Zubaidah,’ Margaret called out as the girl walked away. ‘We really need your help. Do you know where Din is right now?’
	Z stopped and half-turned to face them again. She was still frowning but her face seemed to have softened and she looked puzzled. She shook her head; her hair brushed against her jaw, making her look very young. ‘I don’t know where he is. I would tell you if I did. I can tell he is very important to you.’
	‘Don’t you have any idea?’ Mick said, ‘Please try and think. Did he mention anything to you about where he was going, what his immediate plans were?’
	Z’s frown deepened; she shook her head. ‘No, sorry. I really must go. I’m very late. Goodbye.’ She took a few quick steps and turned once more. ‘Just for the record,’ she added, ‘Din and I were never involved in that way. I don’t have time for silly love affairs.’
	‘You’re young,’ Margaret said. ‘All young people have time for silly love affairs.’
	‘Not me – I have more important things to do than chase after love,’ Z said, half-smiling. She turned to leave, walking fast; when she reached the end of the shaded walkway she broke into a run, kicking up dust in the hazy afternoon sunlight." />

One wall had been more or less removed, exposing the room to the full view of the ravine that fell away steeply to the clean dark waters below. In the distance, the hills formed an undulating ridge covered in bamboo. Against this backdrop Karl had built a platform; and it was on this flimsy wooden dais that his model now posed. She was a glum-looking girl of about eighteen or nineteen, sitting with her legs folded, idly drawing invisible circles on the floor with her index finger.
	‘What do you think? Do you like it?’ Karl said to Margaret without looking at her. His eyes shifted languidly between canvas and model. He painted in short jerky strokes, his wrist flicking rapidly in vertical movements or dabbing delicately at the canvas.
	‘Um, yes,’ Margaret hesitated. The painting was a mess, she thought: splotches of vivid colour that bled into each other, violent green hills in the background and the head of a long-necked woman who bore little resemblance to the model.
	‘No, not the painting,’ said Karl, noticing the direction of Margaret’s gaze, ‘my new studio. I couldn’t have found it without your help.’
	Margaret shrugged. ‘I didn’t do very much. I just pointed you in the right direction, that’s all. There are lots of painters around Sayan, and I knew you’d feel at home.’
	‘I feel more than just at home,’ he replied, pausing to turn to her, paintbrush poised feather-like in mid-air. She had never before seen a face so clear, so animated. ‘I feel this is where I was supposed to be all my life, my rightful place in the universe.’
	‘I hope you’re not going to say “spiritual home”. That’s what they all say.’
	‘The light,’ he continued, as if she had not spoken, ‘is perfect. The vegetation, the temples – everywhere I look there is something my eye is not accustomed to. I feel like Gauguin must have felt when his ship first arrived in Tahiti.’
	Margaret peered over his shoulder and examined the painting. There was certainly a lot of Gauguin in it: the vivid patches of colour; the doe-eyed girl whose bodiless head already bore the obligatory frangipani flower behind the ear; her demure, enigmatic regard, looking yet not-looking at the beholder, inviting yet repelling the Westerner (no, Margaret thought: the Western man; she herself was neither drawn nor repulsed, merely bored). Margaret remembered her mother showing her picture books with colour plates of Gauguin." />

Even at the age of twelve she didn’t like what she saw. She did not find it the least bit surprising when her mother told her that Gauguin had died of syphilis." /> 
	<TS ID="TS273" SPANS="471810~477631" ACTORS="A3,A12,A180" LOCATION="L148" NAME="Margaret meets Nyoman in the studio of Karl" TYPE="Narration" PER="A3,A0,A12" TEXT="‘Look at her,’ Karl said, ‘isn’t she perfect? So wonderful to paint. Her name is Nyoman. Isn’t that the most wonderful name? Nyo-man. It sounds like something rare and delicate.’
	‘It just means “third child”. Every third Balinese you meet is called Nyoman, male or female. Where did you find her?’
	‘In the village. She was sitting by the road with a group of women – it was just like Gauguin – and they waved at me and wanted me to stop and chat. I was overwhelmed by their openness, the warmth they offered to a complete stranger – but also a bit sad, because I knew I would never be able to capture how I felt on canvas. I thought I should try, nonetheless, and therefore I asked Nyoman if she would come and pose for me. Fortunately, she agreed. I’m having trouble getting her skin tone the colour it should be. Look. Should be clearer than that. But I think I have the form of her body just about right. It’s quite unlike painting occidentals.’
	Margaret looked at the outline of the body on the canvas, the flesh yet to be filled in; it was slinky and lithe. The girl herself was, thought Margaret, quite plump and already running to fat, as was quite often the case with girls in this area, where the harvests were dependable and the droughts rarely severe. Above her sarong her breasts were full and heavy, her arms stout, almost muscular. This Nyoman girl was only a few years older than her, but she was already a woman – a woman with an identifiably womanly body, ready to bear children. Margaret folded her arms across her chest; she felt like a flat-chested, malnourished urchin, a tiny stripling.
	‘Look at the grace with which she moves,’ Karl continued, ‘it’s as if she will forever be a child, even though she’s already a woman.’
	‘She’s still only eighteen, you know,’ Margaret said, arms still folded tightly across her chest.
	‘I’d forgotten how effortless their movements are here in the Indies,’ said Karl, as if Margaret had not spoken. ‘We occidentals lost this sense a long time ago – centuries, maybe even millennia. We lost touch with the primitive, unspoilt parts of ourselves, so we no longer know what it is to be innocent and childlike. Look at Nyoman, for example, look at her elegance.’
	Aware that she was being discussed (even an untuned Balinese ear could understand Karl’s maceration of her name), Nyoman raised herself slightly and shifted her weight to adjust her sarong. She looked up at Margaret with bored, bloodshot eyes and broke into a rich soupy cough; she turned her head and spat a thick glob of phlegm into the bushes beyond the platform, projecting it so cleanly and powerfully that it rustled the foliage.
	‘Elegant. That is the word, I think,’ Karl said, frowning in concentration as he stirred a pool of paint on his palette; it was the colour of mud after heavy rain. ‘Life in Europe is no longer elegant. It is no longer sensitive or welcoming or warm. No, we are no longer innocent. We have had our childhood snatched away from us and now we are old argumentative men, decaying and ready to go to war at any moment.’
	‘Why do you always paint women like that?’
	‘What do you mean?’
	‘With long necks and angular cheekbones. I mean, all of you do it. Walter, who really started this trend, I suppose, he paints them with thin curving necks and seductive eyes – when he bothers to paint women at all, that is. Boys are really his thing, as you know. Rudolf is the same, though his women are a bit more interesting because they’re sinewy and lean, just like men. Which, of course, they are – men with breasts and feminine lips; he’s really quite repressed, Mother says, not at all like Walter. Jos Smit isn’t a homosexual – well, at least I don’t think he is – and yet he paints his women in the same way. And now you. You’re not all copying each other, are you?’
	Karl turned to look at Margaret. His sand-coloured eyebrows were clenched tightly in a frown. ‘Do you think my work is…derivative?’
	‘I wouldn’t say that, no,’ said Margaret quickly, though she was aware, even as she said it, that she sounded less than convincing. ‘I mean, you have wonderful use of colour. Look,’ she waved a hand at the canvas, over the spot where patches of orange lay next to strips of absinthe green: the morning sun falling on the hills (or at least that was what she thought it was). ‘No one else in Bali does it this way. It’s really, um, unique.’
	Karl returned to his canvas and began to dab some of the mud-coloured paint into the outlines of the torso.
	‘So,’ said Margaret, ‘do you think you’ll stay here in Sayan, then? For good, I mean. You know what? Your use of light is really very arresting. Wow.’
	‘Yes, I’ll stay,’ said Karl, not looking up from his painting. ‘I don’t want to move any more. This is my home now. I never want to move again.’
	‘Great.’
	Karl set his brush down and turned to Nyoman, gesturing at her with upturned palms; the session was over for the day. ‘I like it here, I’m happy.’ (He did not sound happy, thought Margaret.) ‘The people here like me and I like them. I like them very much.’
	Nyoman rose from the platform and coughed some more. She came round to look at the painting and giggled, raising her hand to her mouth. ‘Poor thing,’ Karl said, stroking her brow gently. ‘I don’t think she’s feeling very well, even though she protests otherwise.’
	‘Maybe she has tuberculosis,’ said Margaret.
	Karl looked anxious; he laid his palm on Nyoman’s forehead, checking for fever. ‘You think so? Just as well I’ve asked her to come and live here with me. I think it will be good for her – and for me. I need my muse near me.’
	‘That will be a cosy arrangement for everyone.’
	He smiled weakly at Margaret. ‘I’m very optimistic about my new life here. I feel settled, after all these years. It’s just an instinctive thing. You understand, don’t you? I know you’re still a child, but somehow I feel we’re very similar.’
	‘Actually, I’m not sure I do understand.’
	‘Will you come and visit again? Soon?’
	‘Sure. Maybe. Yes, well, it’s not the easiest place for me to get to. Anyway, au revoir, as they say.’
	‘Au revoir.’" />

The journey had taken nearly two hours and the paths had become very muddy. She had slipped and fallen heavily on her shoulder and now her neck felt sore too. She was filled with a thick, insoluble despair, something so rich and dark that she thought it physiological: she felt nauseous, and there was a bitter taste in her mouth. Maybe she was catching a cold, she thought as she dried her hair and struggled out of her wet clothes. As she changed she noticed how small her clothes were – a child’s clothes. She hated them.
	She found her mother in her study, sitting amidst piles of photographs, all of which appeared to be of the same people – Balinese dancers who looked dead.
	‘No, they’re not dead,’ her mother said, busily sorting through the prints in no apparent order. ‘They’re in a trance. Your father and I have been taking photographs of them. It’s going to be a very comprehensive record. What’s wrong with you? You look decidedly pale. I would ask your father to take your temperature, but he’s off somewhere with one of those amusing homosexual painters, hunting for butterflies. At least, that’s what he said. I hope it wasn’t a euphemism for something pederastic. I’ve just lately had a faint suspicion that he might be doing slightly more adventurous fieldwork than he’s admitted to, though of course that wouldn’t bother me in the slightest.’
	‘Mother, I’m not feeling very well.’
	‘What is the matter with you? You hardly ever get sick. There was that one time in Tchambuli when you were bitten by a viper and had convulsions, of course, but you’ve never been sick since. Let’s have a look at you. Why on earth are you crying? Oh god, it’s that silly thing young Westerners call love, isn’t it? Who is it? That delicate new Dutch boy? Listen, Margaret Bates, there’s only one thing I can tell you in these matters: never allow yourself to become too attached to a man – or a woman, for that matter, though men seem somehow worse. I’ve seen this boy; he’s very engaging, but soon he’ll be gone. I don’t know if it’ll be one month or five, one year or five, but they all move on. Man is a restless creature, nomadic at heart. We all seek new experiences, and that’s the way it should be. Somehow it’s easier for the male animal to do it than the female, but if you remain truthful to yourself you’ll soon find that you are a nomad too. Don’t settle down, darling; your home is where you are. You’re in control. Not Karl de Willigen or anyone else. Falling in love is just a notion. You can control it like anything else. Now, do stop crying. Boil yourself some water and make a pot of tea. I have to press on with my trance dancers.’" />

Margaret lay in bed without moving, blinking in the darkness, arms laid flat beside her. She tried to remove all thoughts of Karl from her consciousness, filling her head instead with a steady blankness. The emptiness brought relief but not sleep. Some time after midnight she heard her parents arguing, their raised voices puncturing the fragile peace of her non-sleep, and suddenly she could see an image of Karl in her mind’s eye; his slim hands and tawny hair, or his new house, perched precariously on the ridge. Or Nyoman. She could hear Karl’s lilting voice too, and then she’d have to start again, this conscious process of deleting each image one by one, extinguishing them each time they resurfaced, like figures from a shadow play that refused to die. Pull yourself together, Margaret Bates, she repeated; you can do it. There, you see? Falling in love is a matter of choice. Gradually she began to feel better and, some time towards dawn, as sleep finally came to her, she felt herself falling out of love with Karl." />

Light was falling onto the floor in a stream of constant colour. He looked up: a crystal chandelier hung above him, its sharp nose pointing towards him like a huge icicle which he feared would crash down upon him at any moment. The dark shiny floor reflected the light, and when Adam looked down he could make out the blurry outline of his face and body. At first he did not recognise himself; he looked different, as if lost in another world where all shapes, all things, all people were altered, only a fraction, but enough for him not to be sure where he was. Every time he moved the light would change completely and half his body would be shaded; and if he turned his head slightly, part of the ceiling would suddenly shift and make him seem taller.
	He was surrounded by beautifully dressed people – the men in Western-style suits or military uniforms, the women in long dresses that swept around their ankles. They were wearing jewels, too, these women – necklaces and brooches and earrings the likes of which Adam had never seen before. He tried not to look, to keep walking steadily; the problem was that he did not know where he was going. Young men in hotel uniforms paused before him. He could tell that they wanted to ask him what he was doing there, but he knew that as long as he kept moving he would be safe. He needed to keep calm and act as if he knew this place.
	There were soldiers guarding the doors. None of them had even looked at Adam as he walked in. There had been a group of young men, not much older than himself, getting out of a minivan just as he arrived. They looked like sportsmen – footballers, maybe. They were dressed simply but neatly, as Adam was, some of them clutching cameras. They were excited to be there, smoothing their hair with both hands and buttoning the top button of their shirts, wanting to look smart. Adam had slipped in with them, trying to blend in. He’d combed his fingers through his hair the way they did and made sure his collar was closed at the neck.
	And now they were drifting away, shuffling uncertainly on the smooth floor of the lobby, and Adam was alone again. He tried to remember Din’s instructions: he looked around for the Batik Bar but could not see it. There were too many people here. Someone approached him and he drew back instinctively. A young woman dressed in a kebaya was holding something out to him, a tray bearing purple-and-white orchids, each one wrapped in a glossy green leaf, held together by a gold pin, and he understood that he was meant to take one of the orchids. At the far end of the lobby he saw a staircase, broad and curving, lined with gold banisters, leading to a mezzanine level that overlooked the lobby; if he could just get there he would be able to go up to the gallery and get a clear view of everything. He made his way slowly towards the staircase, but he could walk no more than a few steps before finding his path obstructed. People stood chatting in large groups and Adam did not wish to announce his presence by saying ‘excuse me,’ so each time he met an obstacle he had to stop and search for an alternative route. Each time he brushed past someone he felt the heavy bulk of his bag; it seemed to have become even bigger and more prominent since he had stepped into the hotel.
	The stairs were not far now. A large party of foreigners – Japanese, he thought – blocked his way. Another waiter came by with a tray, this time bearing glasses of cold honey-coloured drinks. He paused not far from Adam, hesitating; Adam could tell that he was not sure whether he should serve Adam. He looked like a boy from the islands, Adam thought, maybe even from Perdo. Maybe he recognised Adam from somewhere. He looked directly at Adam’s face, then dropped his gaze to Adam’s feet, scrutinising every item of Adam’s clothing before staring once more at his face. And then he turned away, offering his tray to a European man nearby.
	Adam felt the strap of the satchel beginning to chafe on his collarbone. Every time he moved, even if it was just to turn his head, it rubbed painfully against his skin. For a few moments he thought about opening the bag and taking some of its contents out in order to lighten the load. But he knew he could not do that. He knew he could not open the bag here in the lobby; he did not even want to think about it. All he needed to do was to find the toilets and leave the bag there. Then he could walk away and continue with Life, whatever Life was now. If he did what Din told him, Din would help him find his brother. They would go to Malaysia together and find Johan, and there would be a New Life, one which would not be burdened by empty memories.
	He noticed a parting in the group of Japanese men: a small gap, just enough to squeeze through. It would not last long. Adam pushed his way through this narrow corridor, turning his body sideways so that he barely brushed past the men. Someone moved, knocking into him; he felt the softness of the man’s jacket against his cheekbone and caught the whiff of fragrant aftershave; he heard the man say ‘sorry’ but he did not turn back. He was at the foot of the stairs when he noticed a sign, a square board painted with a colourful motif of batik patterns. The gold letters and the arrow on it indicated where the bar was; Adam headed in that direction and soon saw another arrow pointing the way to the men’s lavatories. Din was right, he thought, it was so easy. There was nothing to worry about.
	The lavatories were cool and silent, sheltered from the bright chatter of voices in the lobby, lit only by wall sconces which cast a faint amber glow. The walls were of black marble, flawless and shiny even in the absence of bright light; and in one corner there was a large white orchid plant whose leaves were beginning to turn leathery and brown at the edges. An old man in a white uniform was wiping around the washbasins with a dirty cloth; he worked slowly, moving the rag in lazy, uneven circles, watching Adam in the mirror. A sudden hiss made Adam start: the urinals filled with water that gushed loudly, reverberating in the quiet space. Adam went quickly to the cubicle at the far end of the row of four; he locked the door and remained very still, listening out for the old janitor as the flushing of the urinals subsided. At first he thought he could hear the limp flopping of wet cloth on hard marble, but then there was silence. The janitor’s rubber-soled shoes squeaked on the floor but Adam could not tell where he was. Adam lowered the loo seat, letting it fall with a clatter. He coughed. Still he could not tell if the janitor was there. He lifted the satchel from his shoulders and placed it very gently behind the loo, deep in the corner. Even if someone came into the cubicle he would not see the bag unless he looked for it. Now that he had got rid of the bag he felt free and unencumbered once again. But if the janitor saw him emerge without it he would be in trouble; he had to wait until the old man had gone before he could leave.
	He waited and listened: nothing. Was that someone moving? He held his breath and listened again. Was that the sound of running water, a pipe somewhere? In the lobby a band had begun to play, something bright and brassy, with wind instruments – a trumpet, Adam thought. It made it difficult for Adam to discern the different noises – which sound was being made by whom? He had to make a decision: if he stayed in the cubicle for much longer the janitor would begin to get suspicious. He coughed again, though he did not know what for – it sounded less unnatural than standing there in complete silence. He listened again: still nothing, as far as he could tell. He reached out and touched the door of the cubicle, feeling the smoothness of the varnished wood in this little cell. He waited and wondered: how would this end?" />

They had been sitting on the steps in front of their house, early in the evening; the sun was disappearing theatrically below the horizon as it did on every clear evening in Perdo. They were trying to fix the wireless, which had broken, and it was taking them a very long time. Tell me again about the War, pak, Adam had said; so Karl told how he had left Bali by stealth, in the dead of night. Adam loved this story of danger and adventure. He loved hearing how Karl had travelled by boat for weeks until finally he reached Holland, thinking it was safer for him there, but then Holland was invaded anyway. Adam loved hearing Karl say, ‘I lay in bed every night praying that I wouldn’t die because if I died I would not be able to get back to Indonesia; I used to dream about being somewhere else, in another world far far away.’ Why didn’t you want to stay in Holland? Adam had asked. And Karl said simply, ‘I don’t know why. All I knew is that I had to come back here, to where I belonged. Life is like that, son.

He walked briskly, past the Batik Bar and back out into the lobby. This time there was even less space amongst the people, but Adam was more insistent than he had been before, working his way through the tight maze of wool and silk-clad bodies; he muttered quick ‘excuse me’s and ignored the sighs of annoyance that he received in reply. He fixed his sights on the great cubic chandelier that hung over the centre of the lobby: if he could just make it to that point he would then be able to make a break for the doors beyond.

The song finished and they began ‘Bengawan Solo’. He heard a murmur of approval, a sigh of nostalgia accompanied by a ripple of applause. But above the music Adam sensed something else. A few soldiers had come into the lobby, spreading out as if to look for someone; with them was the waiter who had looked at Adam earlier, the one who had not wanted to serve him drinks, who was now pointing in the general direction of the Batik Bar. The soldiers raised their heads to try and see into the crowd. Adam bowed his head; he knew they were looking for him.
	A few more soldiers stood outside the doors, facing in. These ones had guns, cocked and ready. Some of the guests in the lobby noticed that soldiers had come into the building. Adam paused next to a middle-aged couple. ‘What’s happening?’ the woman asked. ‘Oh, nothing, darling, don’t worry,’ replied the man, but he sounded worried. The music continued, but Adam could feel the unease in the crowd; some people had stopped talking and were watching the soldiers push their way towards the lavatories. Adam looked up briefly in the direction of the doors. He would make a run for it; he would wait until a new group of people arrived, and when the doors opened to let them in he would make a dash for it. Hadn’t Din said that the President himself was due to arrive very soon? Surely no one would notice a boy slipping out just as the President’s entourage arrived. He had to keep calm, be patient, then break for freedom. Chance, he thought, just surrender to chance.
	But no one seemed to be arriving. Whereas previously there had been a constant stream of guests stepping from limousines, now it was as if the hotel had been sealed off. Adam looked around him, trying not to raise his head too much. The noise had died down; just a bit of nervous laughter, one or two men trying to sound jolly; all other sounds were drowned out by the music. The song was definitely ‘Bengawan Solo’, even though the band played it as though it were a military march. Adam tried to remember how it really sounded; he imagined it playing on the radio as it always did; children would sing it at village celebrations and their parents would become teary and melancholic and talk about the war and the occupation. ‘Bengawan Solo…Trapped by mountains/you journey forever and finally/escape to sea.’ ‘But it’s just about a river,’ Adam would say to Karl. And Karl would smile and say, ‘Not just that, son; one day you will see.’ Adam thought about this now, and he remembered how the song really sounded, away from this place.
	He would make a break for it. At the count of three. A path had formed between him and the doors, a narrow alley that snaked its way through the static crowd. Adam began to step forward, feeling a sudden surge of strength in his legs. But at the end of his path he suddenly saw the waiter who had been looking for him, the waiter who was definitely from the islands and who knew that Adam did not belong in this place. The waiter raised his hand, beckoning to the soldiers. He was waving them over to Adam, pointing into the crowd to where Adam stood. His eyes were wide with fear, and Adam realised it was the first time in his life he had ever inspired fear in someone. He heard the clatter of boots on the marble floor across the foyer. He had to run, he knew he had to, but he couldn’t." />

What are you doing here?’ Her hair was pulled back from her face; her eyes were lined with black and shaded with a dark turquoise, and her lips were pink and glossy. She wore a blue-and-red kebaya with red shoes; she looked like a film star, Adam thought. ‘It’s me, Zubaidah,’ she said. ‘You know, Z. What a surprise to see you!’ She reached out and took his hand, clasping it between hers as if greeting an old friend.
	Two soldiers were now standing with the waiter. They were looking helplessly into the crowd, but not at Adam. Adam looked at the waiter and caught his eye, just for a second; but the waiter looked away swiftly. He stood with his shoulders hunched; he shrugged and shook his head before sloping away, leaving the soldiers to scan the room for the invisible enemy.
	‘So, are you best friends with the President too?’ She laughed and raised her hand to brush away a wisp of hair from her face; on her wrist she wore a slim silvery watch that glinted shyly.
	Adam shrugged. He could not quite believe that this film-star woman was Z, but the voice was the same, the throaty giggle was the same. It was her.
	‘Isn’t this awful?’ she said, half-whispering. ‘All these terrible people. I’m here because of my father. He forced me to come. My mother’s away and he needs to appear as if he has a nice happy family. What could I do?’ She spread her fingers, palms facing upwards in a gesture of helplessness, and rolled her eyes. ‘In the end even revolutionaries have to do what their parents tell them. I like your shirt. It’s nice.’
	‘It belonged to my father,’ Adam replied.
	They heard raised voices from the far corner of the lobby; a scuffle. A woman gasped loudly; people in the crowd craned their necks and tried to see what was going on.
	‘It’s so stupid,’ Z said. ‘People panic so easily nowadays. Ever since that ridiculous assassination attempt on the President, things have been getting worse. All these rich people think that communists are trying to bomb them to bits at every turn. Look at them. Who would want to bomb this lot? The shrapnel from the jewellery would be terrible.’
	Adam noticed that there were even more guards outside now. Some of them ran into the lobby, heading for the corner where the lavatories were. The music stopped, and everyone could hear the soldiers’ harsh voices echoing in the lobby. There was a murmur in the crowd; a few people began to leave, shepherded by soldiers into their waiting limousines.
	‘Maybe it is serious,’ said Z. Anyway, I think the party’s over.’ The guests were being ushered out of the lobby by the soldiers, and Adam could see that even the band had abandoned their instruments. ‘Come on, Adam, we should go.’
	‘I thought you were with your father?’
	‘He has his own driver. He never comes home anyway – his poor mistress has the pleasure of his company most days.’" />

Two soldiers had emerged from the lavatories, marching briskly with the old janitor between them. His hands were cuffed, resting on top of his head, and he had a bruise on his face which Adam had not noticed earlier. A third soldier was holding the satchel by its long strap; he held it away from his body as though it were a dead animal.
	‘Come on, let’s go,’ said Z. ‘Don’t look. It’s so pitiful. He’s just an old man.’ They walked to a black Cadillac and the driver opened the door for them. When the door closed, Adam found himself cocooned from the city; he could barely hear the noise of the traffic. The car joined the queue of limousines fleeing the hotel, inching its way down the curving ramp.
	‘So, what were you doing at the party, Adam?’ Z asked. ‘I thought you didn’t know anyone in Jakarta.’
	Adam’s limbs suddenly felt lifeless, as if he could not control them. He wanted to lift his hand to wipe his brow but he did not have the strength; he could not even feel where his fingers were. His ribs were very painful again; he had forgotten about them, but now they were hurting again. They were hurting badly and he wanted to throw up. He nodded. That was all he could do.
	‘Adam,’ Z said, lowering her voice. She cast a nervous look at the driver and leant towards him. ‘You’re in trouble, aren’t you? What is it? You can tell me. Listen to me, Adam. Are you OK?’
	He nodded again. He felt the sweat trickle down his temple, following the line of his jawbone before falling onto his neck. He was glad he was in the car and not out there, out in the city.
	The Cadillac eased its way onto the road and joined the barely moving traffic. Through the tinted windows they saw more soldiers on the street. A group of them were surrounding a man on his knees; like the janitor, he had his hands on top of his head. A soldier reached into the man’s shirt pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He tossed them towards his friends and smacked the man on the head, a heavy blow with an open palm which made the man tumble forward, his hands reaching out to break his fall. He picked himself up and returned obediently to his previous position, kneeling, hands on his crown – like one of those child’s toys that twists into a hundred different shapes but always folds back into the same position. And although the man had his head bowed, both Adam and Z could see that it was Din.
	Z looked at Adam. Her eyes were calm and she did not say anything for a while.
	‘Are we heading home, Miss Zubaidah?’ the driver asked.
	Z nodded. ‘Quickly Please.’ She did not stop looking at Adam. She said, ‘You’re coming home with me.’" />

Margaret coughed to indicate her presence, and then simply told her mother that she had booked her passage to Europe – to Paris. Her mother did not reply for quite some time; she simply regarded Margaret with a look of confusion and annoyance, the long spear-like stick held aloft in her right hand like an oversized conductor’s baton. Margaret felt quite proud of herself. It was just the kind of thing her mother would have done; she had out-mothered her mother.
	‘When are you going?’
	‘Next week,’ Margaret replied in a tone of voice that suggested mild irritation, as if it were obvious what the answer would be.
	It took her mother a good few seconds to regain her composure. ‘Well,’ she said, finally, ‘that sounds like fun! Don’t be too dissolute, will you – you know what those Parisians are like.’ She waved the stick as though cracking a whip or a riding crop; the students chuckled.
	Outside, the trees had turned the landscape into a patchwork of gold and rust.

They roamed the decks calling after each other in high-spirited voices, arranging rendezvous in the first-class dining room, or tumbling noisily into their expensive cabins. The men were strong-boned and floppy-haired, the women sophisticated, almost world-weary, even at that age. Margaret thought she recognised two of them from Cornell; she could not remember their names but knew that she did not wish to speak to them.

She found the address and stood outside the house for a while, wondering what she was doing there. Don’t be silly, Margaret Bates, she said aloud to herself, he isn’t here. She even smiled at her own stupidity and wondered if one day in the future she would look back and be embarrassed at how ridiculous she had been. And yet she remained standing there for a while, looking up at the windows, trying to remember which one of them Karl would have stood at. At the end of the street there was a pretty iron gate that led into the Luxembourg Gardens. She strolled along the gravel paths, under the drooping branches of lime trees that were shedding their leaves in the wind. She spent many afternoons walking in these gardens, not knowing what to do next." />

She loved the shiny brass railings and plush red furnishings, but she did not love the elegantly bored waiters and the immaculately dressed men who looked up at her with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. ‘Vous-êtes seule, madame?’ the man at the door asked. She hated the way he said madame with an almost imperceptible stress on the first syllable; the over-formal politeness made her feel unwelcome, and old. She didn’t like being called ‘madame’. She was only twenty-seven – still very much a mademoiselle. She held her menu upright so that it hid her from the stares of the respectable men around her. Her clothes felt shapeless and dull and slightly soiled, and under the table her shoes seemed clunky and enormous. She spent a long time looking at the menu because it comforted her to have it in front of her – a shield behind which she remained safely anonymous. She thought she would have something elegant, a sole meunière, maybe; but when the waiter came to take her order she suddenly thought: No, I am not going to have a delicate piece of fish, I am going to have something big and smelly and disgusting. She put down the menu and said, ‘Andouillette. I will take the Andouillette.’ She had never had it before but she knew it was pig’s intestines, rolled up into a squat sausage, perfectly revolting. She smiled and sat with her coat on, her chin lifted to meet the gaze of anyone who stared at her. When her food arrived it was worse than she had imagined – a length of pungent meat covered in charred scabs. She cut off a big piece of it and tried to swallow it whole, like an oyster, but found herself gagging; she lifted her napkin to her mouth and coughed to hide her discomfort, starting to chew furiously until the moment of danger had passed. You are going to finish this, Margaret Bates, she thought to herself, you are going to finish every last bit of this. With each acrid mouthful she felt more resilient. She took a big gulp of red wine, which she didn’t really like, but it took away the taste of the intestines; before long she had finished a whole carafe and ordered another. It wasn’t so difficult: she could do this. She looked at the other diners with a half-smirk, challenging them to disapprove, but they looked away; only one man with a thick moustache smiled back, almost encouragingly. For dessert she had tarte tatin and two cups of coffee, which dulled the sharp taste of urea that lingered in her mouth. She paid the bill and left a generous tip which she could not really afford. She enjoyed watching the waiter nod in grudging acknowledgement as he came to collect the silver tray, for somehow it made her feel strong and even a bit wicked, especially when she thanked him with a flourish. He inclined his head slightly and avoided her steady gaze, and that, too, made her want to smile." />

It was a long way to her hotel, too far to walk. She had kept her coat on in the restaurant and only now, in the fading afternoon, did she realise that she had been sweating. She had been sweating in the restaurant and now she was cold. She was cold and she had drunk too much wine. Maybe she could make her way to the Luxembourg Gardens again, where she would watch the children running amidst the piles of fallen leaves, laughing and calling out to their young mothers. She could sit on a bench, maybe, near the curving stone balustrade that Karl had liked when he was a young man, younger than she was now. She would like that, she thought. As she began to walk a man fell in step beside her. It was the man with the moustache who had smiled at her during lunch. He wore a grey herringbone coat and a felt hat. ‘Bonjour,’ Margaret said. She realised how miserable she sounded, how miserable and cold and lonely. They walked for a while and chatted about things that Margaret cannot now remember. What she can recall is that after some time they reached a handsome building of pale stone. They paused at the heavy door. It was painted black and carved with foliage; next to it there were dark plaques with Cabinet Médical and people’s names written in gold letters. They went up to a room. In it there were two armchairs and a sofa covered in old blue cloth embroidered with gold bees. There was a beautiful writing desk and a neat pile of cream-coloured paper on it. He lit the fire, and when she felt warm again he led her into a smaller room, where there was a bed and nothing else. This is what you call a garçonnière, Margaret thought.

She liked going to his pied à terre, which was warmer than her lodgings and not at all draughty. They went to the Louvre to look at paintings. He showed her a gallery full of portraits of heroic figures, Roman soldiers preparing for war, swords aloft, their women weeping in distress. There was another painting in the same style, of a man lying dead in a bathtub. Margaret did not like these paintings, but she did not say so. She found them mannered and showy, and embarrassingly artificial; Karl would not have liked them, she thought. As she stood with Georges in front of a large canvas depicting a mass of beautiful classical warriors (Spartan, she thought, though she wasn’t sure and didn’t really care), she saw a young man making notes. He had made a sketch, too, a crude one showing the principal figures as jellylike blobs with arrows showing their names. He looked up at her and winked, and then continued to scribble. He was writing in English, she noticed." />

	‘Are you English?’ she asked, although he was obviously Mediterranean, not at all Anglo-Saxon.
	He shook his head. ‘Australian. You?’
	‘Guess.’
	He narrowed his eyes and shook his head, smiling. ‘French? Dutch? Don’t know. Have I failed a really important test?’
	Margaret laughed. She was pleased he did not say ‘American.’ She liked his dark eyes and timid smile.
	They were both young and lonely in Paris, which is a terrible place to be young and lonely. And so they became friends.
	Her days did not seem so long and empty now, and she no longer dreaded the winter nights that started midway through the afternoon. They went on long walks together, and Margaret was glad to have company, for it meant that she did not have to think about Karl and the places he had been. Their walks were sometimes guided by her new friend, sometimes haphazard; she no longer felt obliged to trace the invisible path of Karl’s former life in this beautiful cold city. She was also glad to be able to speak in English, a language she’d never thought she would miss. It was silly of her to be glad of this, she knew, but she was glad all the same. Even better than speaking English was listening to it, and on their walks she would often remain quiet for long stretches, just enjoying the sound of her companion’s voice. He talked a lot; he knew many things about many things. He told her about Rimbaud, for example, who at twenty-two, joined the Dutch army as a mercenary to fight guerrillas in Aceh, but after a few brief weeks witnessing malaria, dysentery, snakebites and amputation, fled the East Indies. Rimbaud believed that in life, one will go where one does not want to go, do what one would rather not do, and live and die in not at all the way one ever had in mind. ‘Isn’t that so true?’ Mick exclaimed. ‘Look at us!’
	Margaret also learnt the following things: that her new companion was called Michael, that he was of Greek descent, and that there were many Greeks in Australia; that his descendants were from Laconia, but his parents had been uncommunicative rather than laconic; that, on leaving home on the eve of the battle from which he would never return, Leonidas, a great Laconian, advised his wife simply: ‘Marry a good man and bear good children.’
	Margaret could ask Michael anything, and he would have the answer:
	‘Do you know a poem by Victor Hugo – something about a ladybird, and a boy who wants to kiss a girl?’
	‘Of course. “La Coccinelle”’.
	‘What happens in it? A boy thinks a girl wants him to kiss her, but instead all she wants him to do is to get rid of a bug on her neck. Is that right?’
	‘Hm. No. Let me think. No. The girl wants the boy to kiss her, but doesn’t say so. She says, “Something is tormenting me, look.” And she offers her face and neck to the boy. But the boy sees only the insect, and not the kiss. It’s about missed opportunities in life, about being too bashful and not taking your chance when it presents itself to you; about regretting things in old age – about not grabbing those fleeting moments of love, I suppose. Why do you ask?’
	‘Oh, no reason. It just came into my mind.’
	In truth it didn’t really matter what she and her new Laconian friend spoke about. Margaret simply enjoyed the unfamiliar yet somehow comforting cadences of his voice, reminding her of another part of the world far, far away from Europe and even further away from America. It reassured her to know that this other world was still there, and that she had not forgotten it." />

	‘Sorry,’ she said, withdrawing slightly. The rich smell of camphor mixed with other medicinal fragrances filled his nostrils. Z dipped her fingers into the jar of ointment and reached for Adam’s ribcage again. ‘Think of something else – your home, or the sea. Something nice.’ She touched him lightly, resting her fingertips on his skin for a few moments to let him get used to her touch, waiting for him to calm down. When she felt the tenseness of his body ease and the rise and fall of his breathing return to a steady rhythm, she began to spread the ointment across his ribcage. At first it seemed she was barely touching him, her fingers skimming over the tautness of his skin. Adam held his breath; he held up his arm, bent at the elbow, his hand bunched into a fist, as if shielding himself from imminent danger. He tried to relax but the tickly, pleasurable sensation of Z’s fingers running lightly over his skin made him want to giggle and gasp at the same time. He knew that if he laughed, his ribs would tense up and hurt him again, so he remained caught in this funny in-between state: he wanted desperately to be soothed but could not allow himself to be.
	‘I think you’ve cracked a rib,’ said Z. ‘There’s a bad bruise just here.’ She circled a forefinger softly on a patch of skin, and all of a sudden Adam recognised that she had alighted on the very epicentre of his pain, the precise root of the nausea that had filled his entire body. She continued to rub the ointment into his skin, more firmly now; a hot, comforting glow began to spread across his torso. He could still feel the pain in his ribs every time her hand passed over that spot, but it was duller, no longer sharp and surprising; it was isolated now, and he could anticipate how and when it would hurt him. Z’s fingers worked steadily in long gentle strokes or in widening circles, away from the tenderness of his ribs, moving on to his back and the sides of his chest. He closed his eyes.
	‘Something’s definitely broken in there,’ she said, and laughed; and Adam could feel the warmth of her breath curling on to his skin, tingling, curious. ‘You’re lucky not to have been seriously hurt. Did you know that nine people died in that riot? And that’s just the number released by the police – the ones they couldn’t deny because they had bullets in their backs.

I don’t know you very well, but that’s how you seem to me: completely empty up here–’ She lifted her finger momentarily and touched her temple, and then returned to massaging him. ‘Do you know what Din and his friends do? They put bombs in people’s cars, people whose views they don’t agree with. You heard about the assassination attempt on the President last year? We think it was Din’s group that was responsible, though we can’t be sure. They are trying to destabilise the country, which is already on the brink of complete collapse.

Let me tell you something, in case you haven’t worked this out. You come from way out there’ – she waved a hand casually in no particular direction – ‘so you won’t understand. In this country, in this day and age, someone like Din is no one. I wish that were not the case, but it is. People like him can die in their thousands and no one would care. He has no power over anything, probably not even his own life. That is the harsh truth, Adam. You are the same now. From the moment you lost your adopted father you joined the masses – just like Din. Money is the only thing that counts. Money gives you power. This is the rule in our new republic. It’s really very simple. This is what I want to change, but until then…’
	Over her voice he could hear the ticking of the clock encouraging her hands on his shoulders. ‘Until then what?’
	Z sighed again. ‘Until then, I suppose I just have to accept that I’m part of the system. Part of this.’ She lifted her hands from his shoulders, and although he could not see what she was indicating with them, Adam knew that she meant the beautiful big house they were in. He was very drowsy now. He wanted her to keep talking.
	‘Yes, I’m a part of this whole disgusting system, a country divided neatly in two,’ Z said, her hands moving up to his neck. A heavy blankness was beginning to fill his head, an intense, pleasurable numbness that seemed to cloud his vision and impair his hearing so that he found it difficult to concentrate on what she was saying. It was a struggle to discern her words; her voice had become a low steady lullaby, measured against the tick-tock of the pendulum and the kneading of her hands. ‘The rich – like me, yes, like me – do anything we please. Everyone else has no hope. They live and die completely by chance, with no control over anything. Sometimes some of them have dreams – like Din, I suppose. They have plans for their lives. But soon they discover that these dreams are worth nothing, and neither are their lives. We, on the other hand, never have plans. Life is simple for us, we just acquire, acquire, acquire. Every day is the same for people like me. We never, ever dream.’
	‘Don’t you?’ Adam mumbled.
	‘No. A dream requires an ideal of some kind. Take my father, for example. He has no ideals. He just takes what he can, as much as possible, and will continue to do so for the rest of his life. He came from a very poor family and he has one simple goal, and that is to distance himself from that poverty. All his friends are the same; they don’t have ideals. You can’t get rich and dream of creating a beautiful country at the same time. So you have to give one of them up: and if you choose wealth then you give up your dreams. This is the reality of it. Someone like Din could not have helped you find your brother, but my father could do it tomorrow, if he wanted to. And it is precisely because he doesn’t have dreams.’
	‘And you? Do you have dreams?’
	Adam felt a weakening in her hands. Something is wrong, he thought; and when he turned to face her he saw that her eyes were moist. She sat on the bed next to him, her arm pressing gently against his. ‘Din and his crazy lot, at least when they think about the future they have a vision of something wonderful. It’s a stupid misguided dream, but at least it comforts them. Me, I don’t have that. Look at this place. It’s not a home. Can you hear laughter, or music? No. There’s just me. And you.’
	She stared at the clock, frowning as if trying to make out the time. Adam thought that she was perhaps waiting for him to say something, but he was afraid he would upset her by saying the wrong thing, so he kept quiet. He shifted so that he was facing her; he smiled, trying to catch her eye, but she continued to look at the clock. In a quiet voice she said, ‘That’s the worst thing. People like me, we don’t have dreams. I talk a lot about changing things, but deep down I know nothing will change. Not ever. That is why I don’t dream, I don’t think about the future. Because when I do, all I see is emptiness.’
	And this was when Adam realised that she was crying. She did not sob or sniff or weep hysterically or do any of the things Adam associated with crying. She did not move; her eyes simply filled with tears, and after a few moments she rubbed the back of her hand across her cheek, quite roughly, as if dislodging an irritation. When Adam reached out and put his hand on hers he found it damp and slightly sticky. His head still felt very heavy. He could smell the sour-sweet odour of her breath, and he could hear her breathing too, one exhalation to every five ticks of the pendulum. She raised her hand and brushed back the hair that fell across his forehead. You have lots of dreams, don’t you? she said. Or that is what Adam thought she said. And then she leaned forward and let her head rest on his shoulder; he could not tell if she was crying. She pulled him gently until he was lying flat on the bed, and he could not stop himself from falling into what he knew would be a very long and very deep sleep. He felt her head on his chest, and the gentle reverberations of her voice in his ribcage, which did not hurt so much any more. Go to sleep now, she said. Go to sleep." />

They stumbled and Farah laughed, a sharp childlike cry that made Johan think that she had hurt herself, but when he turned to look at her he knew she was smiling. Even in the near-dark he could see that she was happy. There were goalposts at one end of the field, three wooden poles nailed together to make a spindly frame whose two feet stood in pools of water. Farah jumped and touched the top bar with her hand as she ran underneath it. Look, Johan, she cried.
	They reached the shelter at the far end of the field that housed a wooden table and some benches. They tugged at the edges of their shirts and tried to wring the water from them, but it was useless, so they just sat on the table with their feet on a bench, out of breath from their dash through the rain, laughing.
	I have mud in my shoes, Farah said, but she did not sound unhappy.
	Me too. I suppose we just have to wait until the rain stops.
	It was not a fierce storm but the rain was still heavy, drumming loudly on the flimsy roof overhead and falling in thin steady streams where the grooves in the zinc sheeting sloped towards the ground. They stared out at the darkness but could not make out any shapes. The goalposts and the seesaw and swings in the children’s playground had disappeared and they could see very little except the pale haze of the rain. Now and then the sky would be lit by a distant flash of lightning and suddenly they would see everything again, the young acacia saplings bending in the wind, the rows of thorny bushes, the merry-go-round. Everything would burst into life for a few seconds and then disappear into the darkness again, and there would only be the soothing rumble of thunder.

	Johan did not say anything for a while. He leant forward and water ran from his hair on to his brow and began to tickle his eyes. He blinked. Yes, I suppose I am.

	Sure.
	Don’t be sad.
	Who says I’m sad?
	Me. Because I’m sad.
	You mustn’t be. Johan looked at her, but she was not facing him and there was not enough light to make out her face. He was glad he couldn’t see.
	Johan. He felt her hand search for his, her fingers stubbing clumsily into his thigh before finding his forearm, then his wrist. She let her hand rest gently on his. It felt very light. She said, Johan, please share with me. Your life, I mean.
	We grew up together. You know my life.
	No, I mean before that. Somehow I feel, oh, I don’t know. I think sometimes that was your real life and when you came to us you stopped living, you just gave up. You shut us out. Even Mummy. Even me.
	I’m still alive and kicking, am I not? Johan laughed. And with his free hand he reached and squeezed hers.
	Johan, she said. She paused. Did something happen to you when you were small? At the orphanage, I mean. It’s just, there’s something I remember when I was very young, maybe eight. You must have been ten, a couple of years after you came to us. I had a nightmare one night and I went to Mummy and Daddy’s room. I don’t know why. I wanted a hug, I guess. They were arguing; not loudly, you know, just softly, keeping their voices down, and Mummy was talking in a really fierce voice, attacking Daddy the way she doesn’t any more. You remember how she used to be when she was younger. I couldn’t hear the exact words, I just remember the tone. And then there was a silence, and Daddy said, So what if I know where the other one is, what do you want me to do, go back and get him? You made the decision, so don’t feel guilty now.
	Above the harsh clatter of the rain on the roof Johan could hear a gentler note, a hushing sound made by the rain falling on the soft earth, on the shallow pools of water that covered the land before them. It was a sound of trees disturbed by the wind, their leaves and branches flailing in the night storm." />

You know what kind of imagination a kid has. Sometimes they dream things up and those things are so much more convincing than real life. That thing I heard Mummy and Daddy say, well, it was so real I thought I must have dreamt it. And anyway, even if it was true, so what? It doesn’t mean anything, because we all know you had a brother, right?
	You’re right, it doesn’t mean anything.
	But…but if that’s the case, why do I feel so guilty every time I think about it? Why do I feel so bad? Why did they sound so full of anguish? Especially Mummy. And even Daddy.

It was in an old book that had become wet some time in its history and all its pages were brittle and stained. The picture was of a person so pitiful that Johan could not really even tell if it were a man or woman or boy or girl. And in the picture this person was doing nothing except gazing into the landscape with an expression so forlorn and lonely that it made Johan feel sick, for this pathetic person was all alone in the world, in a desolate place that looked like everywhere Johan had ever lived. He copied down the title of this picture, Un Fou Dans Un Morne Paysage, and when he looked up the meaning of this in a dictionary at school, he learned that the person was a madman. Johan had not thought of the poor creature as a madman. He was just someone who was alone in a barren place. But maybe that was what it meant to be a madman. Perhaps being really, truly alone in a desolate world meant that you were mad, because you could not understand this world that belonged to others. Johan thought that maybe he himself was mad.

	Imagined what?
	Everything. The orphanage, my brother, coming to live with you. I wish I had imagined it all, but I know I didn’t. You know how people say that things fade with time, that your memory becomes weaker? It doesn’t. Everything becomes clearer. And you see it all the time. All the time. You try and run away from it, but it just follows you every second of the day and night and you can’t escape it.
	What can you remember? Her fingers closed around his hand, pressing gently.
	I can remember Mummy and Daddy coming to the orphanage. Mummy was wearing a dress made from batik, not really a kebaya but almost. She had a scarf over her head, not a tudung but something that hid her hair and neck. I remember thinking, What a beautiful woman. They were both wearing sunglasses, and they spoke in an accent that I couldn’t really understand. We were brought into the Room. We called it the Room because it was the only proper room in the orphanage, you know, not a dorm or a partitioned space. A room. That was where, where…
	Where what?
	Where you were punished. If you were naughty, they took you there and closed the door, and they punished you. The Brothers, that is. They beat you with a rotan. On your bare skin where it hurt.
	Johan.
	This was where they brought us when Mummy and Daddy came. Both of us. Me and my brother. We stood up and the Brothers told Mummy and Daddy about us, and said all nice things, that we were good boys, always well behaved and quiet, never made noise, and Mummy said, They’re not mute, are they? And the nurse said, No, no, of course not, and Mummy laughed. She made everyone laugh. Daddy kept looking at his watch, tracing its outline with his fingers. The same watch he has now, the Rolex. It must have been new. And the Brothers said, Don’t worry, even though we are a Christian charity these are good Muslim boys, their mother was Muslim, from Sumatra, we think, we’re not sure. I was so happy. I was happy because I knew Mummy wanted us. I knew we were leaving. I was holding my brother’s hand and suddenly I could feel it trembling. He was looking out of the window and not saying anything but I knew something was wrong. One of the Brothers came and put his hand on my brother’s shoulder and his eyes went cloudy and he started to make a noise. Not sobbing, but a weird sighing, and he fell on the floor as if his legs had no strength in them, and I tried to pick him up but his eyes had gone blank, black and blank, and it frightened me. And I called his name over and over again, but he wouldn’t stop, and the more the other people tried to touch him, the worse he became. I ran to him and put my arms round him and then he began to calm down, and I thought he was dying. His breaths were quick, so quick, and hot. The Brothers were saying, So sorry, he’s like this sometimes, it’s not serious, please, it’s not serious. Later, we were in the dormitory, sitting on his bed, and he was OK, completely normal, playing with this thing, a globe with fake snow in it. He just sat there turning it upside down and then back again. Mummy and Daddy stood at the windows watching us, and I heard Daddy say, We can’t stay long, we have a long drive, and then there’s the ferry. You have to decide by tomorrow morning, but I have to say I don’t like the small sick one – oh, never mind. And Mummy said, But the poor thing, he was so weak. It was your stupid idea in the first place, Daddy said. I didn’t know what this meant but I didn’t care, it didn’t seem important. After a long long while Mummy came to me and I could smell her perfume, like roses, so sweet, and she took off her sunglasses and said, Tomorrow we are taking you to our home, all right? And you can’t imagine how happy I was. I felt as if my chest would burst, because I knew we were escaping. They left us alone for a few minutes and I said to my brother, You don’t have to worry any more, we’re leaving. There’s nothing to fear, we’re going away from this place, that lovely woman is going to take us away and we are going to live with her. He looked at me and smiled. He was happy, truly happy. I could not ever remember him looking happy. When the lights went out that night my brother came to my bed and said, Johan, are we really going away? And I said, Yes we are, but as I said it something changed in my head, and I felt scared, I felt scared because suddenly I thought maybe only one of us would go. Please god please god let them take my brother, I said over and over in my head, and after a while I thought, yes, they were going to take my brother because he was smaller than me and often he was sick and they could see that he needed help. He would be lonely without me at first but he would have a nice house to live in and nice parents to look after him and soon he would forget me, and that would be nice. But then I thought, What if they take me instead? He would not survive without me. He slept so soundly that night and hardly moved at all, and his breaths were long and deep and when I looked at him he seemed so peaceful I could have sworn he was smiling. I didn’t want him to be on his own. We had talked so much about doing things together, climbing a mountain, swimming in the sea. You know, the sea was very close to where we were but we had never seen it, never. And suddenly I knew we would never do those things, I knew that Mummy and Daddy would take me and not Adam, so I thought maybe if I, if I…
	If you what? Farah touched his arm lightly.
	If I went away and did not tell anyone, it would be OK, they would have no choice, they would have to take Adam. I remember going to the window and listening for the sounds of the sea. It wasn’t far away but we could never hear it, never. So I, I…
	Breathe slowly, Johan, slow down. Farah stroked his hand. Please.
	OK. Sorry. Sorry. I waited for dawn, and when it came I began to feel better, and I thought maybe there was nothing to worry about, I was being crazy, getting worked up over nothing. When Mummy and Daddy came I felt good again, because they were the nicest people I ever saw. It was early in the morning, and my brother was still asleep. Everyone was still asleep. Mummy came and took me by the hand and said, I want to talk to you, we’re just going to have a quick word, OK? I said, We’re both going, aren’t we? She nodded, I swear she nodded and I was happy again. She had her sunglasses on again and she said, Come along, hurry. Hurry. She walked very quickly. I thought she was going to show me something in the car, but when we got into the car and the doors closed I knew what was happening. The Brothers and the nurse were waving to us, and the car started to move away. A kind of sickness welled up inside me, a terror. I couldn’t move. I wanted to scream and shout for my brother and say, stop, stop, but my body would not move, and I could make no sound. I just knelt on the seat watching the orphanage recede into the distance. There was a cloud of dust that made everything seem yellow, the whole landscape, the trees, everything. And then…
	Shh, Johan, oh Johan, please calm down. Farah touched his face, his wet skin.
	And then I saw, I saw my brother. He was running after the car. He was a long way away, but through the dust I saw his plump legs stumbling in the dirt, until finally he gave up and slowed to a walk, and I heard Daddy say, Don’t look, don’t look. He said it in a quiet voice. I didn’t know if he was talking to Mummy or me. I hear this sometimes in my dreams, when I am all alone. Don’t look. And that’s when I wish I hadn’t looked. It’s when I wish I had dreamt it all.
	You’re shaking, Johan. You’re hot.
	The storm was not abating, but they both wished it would not end, that it would carry on through the night. He lowered his head and rested it on her collarbone, in that safe place between her chin and her shoulder where he could shelter and listen to the storm. Johan said,
	Sometimes when it comes back to me I get so angry because I think to myself, I should have run away that night. Mummy would have taken Adam instead of me and he would have this life, my life. But I didn’t, Farah, I didn’t have the courage.
	She stroked his wet hair and felt his breaths, quick and hot against the chill of her skin.
	You never said what your brother’s name was, she said at last.
	Adam. His name was Adam.
	Adam and Johan. That’s nice.
	It’s been so long since I heard anyone say his name, Johan laughed, and Farah felt his breath on her neck again. She was not so cold now.
	I wish you weren’t going away, she said. I don’t want you to go away.
	I have to go away. There’s nothing else to do. I’m sorry. He shook his head, and she did not know what this meant.
	Lightning. The water dripping from the roof turned into a trail of crystals, just for a moment, before becoming invisible once more in the darkness. And in the brief pale violet light Johan could see Farah’s face, and he could see that her eyes were red and glassy with tears, but he could also see that she was smiling.
	We should go now, Johan, I’m sleepy.
	Now? But it’s still raining.
	We’re already wet, aren’t we?
	He sighed and stood up. Maybe you’re the one who’s really crazy." />

It depicts a large group of people clustered around the steps of a colonnaded veranda; in the distance there is a volcanic mountain, suggestive of a tropical landscape. Most of the figures are dressed in Javanese costume; some are squatting on the ground, forlorn, others hold their heads in their hands, weeping, one presumes. But most of them are looking at a proud figure surrounded by Dutch army officers. This person is Prince Diponegoro, the Javanese aristocrat who led the resistance movement against the Dutch in the 1830s. Executed with great assurance and in a style that is unmistakeably Western, it is easy to see this painting as yet another scene from the annals of European history: the conquer of a foreign land, the easy subjugation of the natives by the sophisticated, upright officers of a Western power. But look again. There is something unusual about these Westerners. Are their heads too big for their bodies? Almost certainly, they are. And now that you’ve noticed this, don’t they look gawky and ill at ease? This isn’t due to a lack of painterly craft, because the Javanese people are beautifully rendered, full of humanity, grace and pride. They do not confront the beholder as the big-headed Dutch characters do, but form part of the landscape; they are dressed not in rags but in sarongs and head-dresses of batik. They may be defeated in this battle, but it is they, not the Dutch, who remain human.
	The artist, Bill Schneider explained earnestly, was a Javanese nobleman called Raden Saleh, who travelled to Holland to study under Kruseman and Schelfhout, excelling early in his career at landscapes and portraiture, which brought great success and made him a favourite of Ernst I, Grand Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in whose home he lived for five years, slipping quite easily, it seems, into aristocratic life in Dresden. All this time, however, Raden Saleh nursed a passion for painting wild animals, in particular, lions. He had once seen some at Henri Martin’s circus in The Hague and was seized by the urge to depict their untameable instincts. He identified with their pride and fiery temperament, and began producing monumental works depicting these wild yet noble beasts attacking snakes, or horses, or Dutch army officers out hunting (never mind that there are no lions in Java). Now back in Yogyakarta, his work took on simple yet striking anti-Western overtones, culminating in the masterful Capture of Prince Diponegoro, which hangs in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam." /> 
	<TS ID="TS311" SPANS="548310~554390" ACTORS="A12,A14,A37" LOCATION="L1" NAME="Margaret and Mick studied the slide under the magnifying glass" TYPE="Narration" PER="A14,A0,A37,A12" TEXT="‘I’m thinking,’ said Bill, ‘I’m thinking that it’ll be a peace offering. A kind of sweetener to make the President more amenable to…well, to things in general. The idea is simple: we arrange for the return of this priceless, hugely symbolic nationalistic work of art to Indonesia, and in return he recognises that we’re good friends of his, not enemies. I’ve been working for weeks now, but I’m not making much headway. The Dutch are not in a giving mood. We’ve had endless negotiations – endless – but they won’t give up these paintings easily.’
	They studied the slide under the magnifying glass, taking turns to peer at it.
	‘This is the one the Indonesian people would want to see back in the country,’ Bill said, tapping his finger in front of the Capture of Prince Diponegoro. ‘It would be very fitting in a grand public space, maybe at the Presidential Palace. It’s noble, dignified, bold in its statement, but still very classy. It’s the subject of our official promptings, the negotiations that are, let’s say, documented.’
	‘Why do I always know that there’s something dirty going on with you, Bill?’ said Margaret as she leaned over to look at the slide. She thought Prince Diponegoro very handsome, but also somewhat fragile underneath his proud regard. She felt more than a twinge of revulsion for the Dutch figures in the painting; she thought them ridiculous and even disgusting. She was falling into the trap, she knew, but she didn’t mind. She did not usually enjoy the sensation of being manipulated or of being slyly coerced into feeling or thinking something, but in this instance it felt entirely natural, as though she ought to side with the Javanese, and that there was no other option.
	‘The question is,’ Bill continued, ‘how much is this painting worth to the President himself? I mean, personally?’
	‘You mean, is it worth giving us oil concessions in Sumatra? Or do you mean, is it worth turning his back on Russia?’
	Bill smiled. ‘No, obviously no painting is going to be worth that much. What I meant was, does the President personally value this painting enough to make him feel favourable towards us again? It’s a grand public statement, but what does he himself feel for the painting?’
	Mick reached for the magnifying glass, almost pushing Margaret out of the way. ‘Hmm, very good,’ he mumbled. ‘Very, very good. This guy knows exactly what he’s doing. Brilliant composition.’ He bent over the magnifying glass, shifting it slightly now and then.
	‘Good, isn’t it?’ Bill said, opening a drawer. ‘But frankly I don’t think it’s quite the thing to push the President’s buttons. It’s too static, too quiet. It demands too much involvement from the viewer. If the President is going to make a grand gift to his nation, he’ll want something more flamboyant. Something, oh, I don’t know, aggressive, something that’s more his style.’ He placed another slide on the desk and slid it towards them. ‘That’s why I’m trying to get this painting too. Another Raden Saleh, not at all well known. I have a feeling that this is more likely to make the President sit up. It’s totally the kind of thing he’d like to have in his private salon, or in his boudoir when he’s seducing some wench. Or even on public display, as if to say, ‘I’m still a powerful man.’’
	Mick moved the magnifying glass over the new slide. ‘Wow. That is quite something. It’s like Delacroix, just like Delacroix, in fact, only a bit rougher, more earthy. Fantastically Romantic. Margaret, look!’
	Margaret noticed Mick’s quick breaths as she took the magnifying glass; his eyes were shining, like a child’s – a child who had just woken up from a long sleep and found a present at the foot of his bed.
	The picture was of two lions and a tiger mauling a chestnut horse that was rearing up in terror, its eyes wild with fear. Its rider – a white man – looked tiny and helpless and strangely calm, as if he had accepted his fate. Margaret felt sorry for him; he wasn’t as beastly as his comrades in the first painting and didn’t, therefore, deserve to be ripped to shreds by these beasts.
	‘It’s called Lions and Tiger Attack a Horseman, dating from Raden Saleh’s time in Paris, not long before he moved back to Java. It’s a monumental work, completely breathtaking in real life, ten by twelve.’ Bill stretched out his arms vertically, reaching for the ceiling, then sideways, as if doing exercises. ‘I heard of it from someone I had dinner with years ago and managed to track it down. It took ages, but I recently found it in a private collection in Geneva. We’re arranging for its purchase – for quite a handsome amount of money, I must say. The owner isn’t keen to sell, says it’s an heirloom or some nonsense, but everything has its price, even family history. Of course, the transaction is not being documented by any newspaper or auction house or dealer. Neither the buyer nor the seller wishes to be identified, I think the expression goes.’
	‘I see what you mean,’ Margaret said. ‘It’s right up the President’s street.’ She was struck by Bill’s unerring instinct for finding the way to appeal to someone’s basest instincts, for knowing exactly what they would like to see or hear. And she realised why she had felt drawn to him all those years ago – not because she had fallen prey to his tricks, but because they were similar in this respect: they could both get what they wanted in order to survive.
	‘The only way to get him on our side again is to appeal to his human instincts, to touch a chord. It’s gotten to the stage where no amount of official aid can make him see eye to eye with us. It’s too late for that. His public rhetoric is way too anti-American for him to back down now. But behind the scenes we can still try and make sure that he finds us, well, of interest. We don’t give a damn what he’s obliged to say in his great speeches, as long as he feels that we can still help him.’ Bill watched Mick pore over the image. He raised one hand to his lips and began absent-mindedly to nibble his thumbnail, his jawbone twitching." />

	He shrugged and laughed. ‘I don’t know. Maybe I’m getting old. But this painting is special. When I saw it, I was blown away. I just stood there, gaping. There was something about it that made everything else I’ve done in my work irrelevant and trivial. It was hanging there on the wall of this grand old apartment in Switzerland, so out of place. And I got that feeling I get when I go to a lousy zoo in a lousy town, and see some huge and powerful jungle animal in a cramped cage, and it’s barely moving because it’s so shell-shocked it doesn’t know what to do any more.

	They stood watching Mick as he raised the image to the light, still holding the magnifying glass to his eye the way detectives did in movies. ‘I want to help you, Bill, honestly, I do,’ said Margaret, ‘but I’ve got to find the boy. He’s out there, alone in a huge city he doesn’t know.’
	Bill moved so that he was standing with his back to Mick, shielding Margaret from Mick’s view. He dropped his voice. ‘Listen, please help me. I can’t do this without you. No one in this whole building can do it. You’re a neutral. The Indonesians don’t really even consider you American. You’re one of them, almost. I’ve fixed everything, all you have to do is talk us through the Palace and get an audience with the President. We need to talk to the big guy himself. None of his acolytes will do. My name is mud over there, and besides, we have to be so careful now. We can’t put a foot wrong – and you know what I’m like, I just can’t judge these guys like you can.’
	Margaret shook her head. ‘No way. Absolutely not. I need to find Adam.’
	‘We’ll get him, don’t worry. Uncle Sam may no longer be valuable to the President, but he still has enough influence at lowly police stations. My contacts have got your Maluddin guy well covered. As soon as they get him, they’ll find the boy too. I’m sorry about Karl, but he just slipped away from that hospital, and I can’t trace him. Zero. But the boy, I know we’ll get him.’ He reached out and touched her, his fingers trying to encircle her wrist. ‘I promise, Margaret.’
	Margaret shook her head and pulled away slightly. ‘I told you, Bill, I don’t know anyone any more. When I was more, I don’t know, in love with this country – yes, I knew how people thought, how they felt and spoke. Sometimes I used to think I knew how they dreamt. For the longest time my dreams were only in Indonesian and I thought, I’m one of them. But now I don’t really have dreams, and when I do I see my mother, god help me. I’m of no use to you or the United States, Bill.’
	‘It’s not a question of use, Margaret, you’re not an instrument of the state.’ He reached out and touched her arm again. ‘I’m asking you to help me as a friend. Yeah, sure, there’s all that governmental bullshit at stake, but you know this painting is worth sticking your neck out for. It belongs here, in this country. I’m going to find that boy even if you don’t help me. It’s not a quid pro quo thing. This isn’t an official request, it’s a personal one. What I need is someone charming and sensitive to help me through this minefield. If I go in there myself – if they let me in – and I say something wrong, I’ll be dead in three seconds.’
	‘I’ve only met the President a couple of times.’
	‘But he remembered you. He asked me about you once. “What happened to that charming administrator with the Ford Foundation? She was so very nice, and she could speak Javanese too. Amazing.” That’s what he said, I swear. If you appear at the Palace, I guarantee he’ll see us.’
	Mick looked up. He held the magnifying glass in the air as if it were a sign. ‘I think it’s a great idea. Margaret can definitely do it. She’s got everything it takes. I’ll come as back-up, if you need me. I can be your bodyguard or chauffeur, anything you please.’

	‘You don’t understand. They aren’t going to hurt a single, unarmed woman. The moment a macho white guy appears it changes the dynamics completely. I’ll unnerve them – which is the point of the exercise – but I won’t threaten them. It’s all to do with the way Asian men see white women, and the way men communicate with other men. Don’t look so sceptical. Trust me. I’m sure of it.’" />

She had been overwhelmed, too, by the emotion of seeing the red-and-white flag everywhere she looked – in proud rows on the lawn, suspended between columns, draped across tables, as though staking a claim on the building. The red of the flag was deep and angry, like freshly spilt blood. She had been dismayed to have missed the formal ceremonies that marked the recognition by the Western world of the new Republic; it irked her to think that she had been in Paris, pining after a lost love that had never even been articulated in the first place (really, how silly), when she could have been here, witnessing the official birth of the nation. It felt to her as though she had been left out of the creation of something that she was a part of, something that was a part of her. She would never be so foolish again. And so she made sure that she was there, milling amongst the crowds the following year during the first Independence Day celebrations. A few years passed before she was invited into the Palace that first time (for an official reception of American educators and academics, though the pretext barely mattered to her), and she was overjoyed to find that this occasion, too, was overwhelming. She had remembered feeling perfectly at home there, enjoying the looks of envy and suspicion from her compatriots as she chattered merrily away in Indonesian with government officials, and even flirted with an air force general." />

It still seemed monumental and noble, but now it also felt forbidding, as if there were a strict set of rules – STOP, do not proceed, SLOW, THIS WAY, remove crash helmet and sunglasses, do not cross, do not speak, do not smile – that she had somehow managed to ignore during previous visits. It was no longer a huge playground full of adventure, but a place where the obstacles were all too real. Her driver did not turn around to look at her, nor did he wish her good luck or even goodbye as she got out of the car; he simply stared straight ahead, hands on the steering wheel, and moved away as soon as Margaret swung the door shut, leaving her marooned at the foot of the steps leading up to the immense porch." />

The suit was too big for him and hung off the sides of his shoulders, making him look smaller than he was. He did not extend his hand for Margaret to shake but waved it gracefully to show Margaret the way. He kept half a step ahead of her, making sure there was always plenty of space between them. He wanted to remain aloof, she thought; his non-verbal communication was saying, ‘I really don’t want you here. You are a pain in the neck and we’re going to try to get this over and done with as quickly as possible.’
	‘Thank you for receiving me at such short notice,’ she said. ‘I’ll try to be as quick as possible. You must be very busy. I really am sorry to trouble you.’
	‘Not at all,’ the man said and smiled, ‘we are in no hurry. You’re very welcome here.’
	That was the way Asians said, You’re really getting on my nerves now. At least she knew that.
	Everywhere she looked, Margaret saw soldiers manning doors or marching briskly along the edges of the lawns in pairs or tightly-knit groups. Older men in military uniform walked along the hallways and disappeared silently into half-open doorways. Some of them looked briefly at Margaret but no one so much as nodded in acknowledgement. She found herself being led through a lavish reception room, her feet sinking into a plush carpet. There were a few armchairs covered in gold damask and a round table with a marble top and gilded, carved legs. On one wall hung a large mirror, also carved and gilded; everything in the room seemed to be carved and gilded; on another wall a row of photographs in (gilded) frames showed the President on Independence Day, leaner than he was now, and fresher-looking, Margaret thought; back in those days he was still more of a revolutionary, less of a hardened statesman. She felt a sudden frisson of excitement, a quick thrilling shudder as she recalled the atmosphere of those dream-like days when the future of the country had seemed clear and full of possibility. She remembered the collective anger over New Guinea, the indignation she herself had felt when Holland refused to hand it back to Indonesia, viewing it as a personal slight, as if the Dutch had taken something from her own home and refused to give it back. When the President declared Indonesia’s intention to take back Papua, she had seen it as the righting of a wrong.
	‘Please wait here,’ said the man in the too-large suit, before disappearing into a door at the far end of the room.
	She had been in this room before, she thought. The view from the windows was still the same: a giant suwar tree, its canopy dominating a stretch of lawn that ran down to the boundary railings; but the room had been much less opulent on her last visit, less gold, no carpet." />

He was smaller than she had expected, but this did not diminish the naked charm he exuded. He was forceful without being forced, convincing in every minute gesture, and his non-verbal language was simple, thought Margaret: he sought to conquer everything he encountered. When he shook Margaret’s hand she felt the roughness of the skin on his palms and saw the pockmarks on his face as he smiled. His first words as he took her hand in his were, ‘And what is your name?’ as if they had been chatting for some time and had presumed some degree of familiarity. He spoke in English, and she, of course, replied in Indonesian: ‘Margaret Bates, honoured to meet you.’ Actually, she had responded not merely in standard Indonesian but in what scant Javanese she knew. It was said that Sukarno was never caught off-guard, but her brief cameo was enough to cause him to raise an eyebrow and incline his head ever so slightly. She enjoyed that. And before he had had a chance to speak, she continued in Indonesian, knowing that she spoke with none of the hesitation that non-native speakers usually did. It was a little hot, wasn’t it, and the rains were late that year, but, well, one mustn’t complain, for at least one wasn’t a rice farmer, poor things. ‘Hm, what an exceptional woman,’ he said. ‘And I was told you were an American!’
	‘Well, hardly. I was born in Irian, you see. The first years of my life were in the farthest reaches of Indonesia.’
	‘If you believe what the Western world says, you were born not in Indonesia but in the furthest reaches of Dutch New Guinea.’
	‘But anyone in their right mind – anyone with a sense of justice – knows that Papua has always belonged to us. I mean, to Indonesia.’
	He smiled. ‘The problem is that it is ours but it does not belong to us, at least not officially.’
	‘Not yet. I’m very heartened to hear of the President’s intention to confront the Dutch.’
	‘You are not afraid of battle, I see.’
	‘It depends on the purpose of battle. Why do we fight? Who are we fighting? We must always ask ourselves this.’
	His eyes were very dark and direct. ‘How wise. We fight to bring nobleness to our souls. Nobleness brings order. Order brings peace. But sometimes the struggle itself becomes, how shall I say, essential. And sometimes,’ he paused and smiled, ‘this fighting makes you feel alive.
	‘Life is a battle,’ she shrugged. ‘Without battle there is no life.’
	He laughed, the lines on his face creasing deeply. ‘What a fascinating American you are.’ He continued to look her in the eye as he moved away, and she lifted her chin to meet his gaze. Afterwards she had felt flushed and giddy with something she could not articulate; it was a feeling that lasted days, if not weeks." />

Before, there had been that pleasant odour of food and wood, slightly musty but entirely welcoming, but now Margaret could smell nothing except the faint whiff of wool carpets. She was certain that there had been a Toraja carving mounted on the wall where the mirror hung; and she could not remember the Venetian chandelier (there had been plain glass lanterns, surely). She sat patiently and drew her fingers idly across the envelope she was carrying, feeling the outlines of the two slides contained inside.
	Someone appeared in the doorway at the far end of the room. It was not her guide with the ill-fitting suit, but a much younger man in a smart, vaguely military-looking suit, not quite a uniform but not really civilian dress either, the buttoned epaulettes and breast pockets giving him the air of an adventurer. There was a coloured emblem stuck to his lapel that looked like a military decoration, but Margaret could not be sure; she was never very sure about these things. He walked briskly, with the upright bearing of a soldier, quickening his stride as he approached her.
	‘So sorry to have kept you waiting,’ he said. ‘I’m one of the President’s aides-de-camp. Hello, pleased to meet you. Unfortunately, there’s been a slight problem. There was an incident yesterday.’ He smiled and frowned at the same time, managing to look at once unruffled and concerned. ‘The President’s schedule has therefore been rearranged.’
	‘Goodness, that sounds serious. Where was it?’
	The smile-frown played across his face once more. ‘Don’t be alarmed, it was nothing serious. A security threat at an official occasion the President was attending – not far from here, actually, right in the centre of town. At the Hotel Java. It shows that such things can happen anywhere. Sadly there is much unrest on the streets of Jakarta these days. We have to treat everything seriously, no matter how minor.’
	‘So where is the President? And does this mean I won’t get to see him today?’
	He smiled, without the frown this time. ‘I’m sorry, but he is – detained elsewhere.’
	She imitated his half-smile, half-frown and stood up slowly. ‘That is a shame, because I’ve brought something of great value to the President, something that would interest him very much. A gift from the people of America.’
	‘The President is not interested in gifts from the United States of America.’ He held his smile firmly.
	‘I understand. But I said that this is a gift of the people of America, the good ordinary people who are his friends. I didn’t say it was a gift from the President of the United States.’
	He hesitated, his smile beginning to weaken. ‘I fail to understand the difference.’
	‘Here,’ she said. ‘See what you think.’ She reached into the envelope and took out both slides, handing him one. ‘I’m sure you’ll be able to recognise its worth.’
	He held it up to the light, turning it from side to side, like a child regarding an unfamiliar new toy. He doesn’t have a clue what it is, thought Margaret. She said, ‘It is something very rare and very valuable.’
	He did not answer, but glanced at her with a look of self-conscious disdain, which Margaret knew was a giveaway signal as to his lack of understanding of the situation. ‘It is something important to the Indonesian people.’
	‘Please do not tell us what the Indonesian people value. I think I would recognise something that was truly valuable to us.’ He lowered the slide and held it out to her, turning his shoulder slightly as if preparing to leave.
	‘It is, above all,’ Margaret said quickly, ‘something dear to the President himself. Something he treasures. Its beauty and value may not be obvious; maybe you and I cannot see it, but the President can. Only he can judge for himself. I wouldn’t dare presume to do so on his behalf. Would you?’ She did not reach to reclaim the slide; it remained almost motionless, tiny and lightweight.
	‘I don’t think this is an important thing,’ he said and looked at the translucent square resting gently between his thumb and index finger.
	Margaret shrugged and made a bowing motion with her head, as if deferring to his decision. She took half a step backwards to show that she, too, was ready to leave. ‘Very well. That decision is yours to make, I understand. But please do remember that what might be valuable to you might not be so to someone else. Beauty and nobility and all the unquantifiable things that the Javanese value are, unfortunately, overlooked by us, the people of the West. There’s so much beauty in this painting. I thought perhaps you – you are Javanese, aren’t you? Yes, I thought so – well, I thought you might see that. But I have done my duty and you have done yours. It is time to bid each other goodbye, I think.’
	The aide-de-camp blinked at Margaret for a moment or two. He shook his arm, flicking his wrist to look at his watch. ‘Follow me,’ he said. ‘I’ll give you three minutes, that’s all.’
	They left the room and walked quickly along a narrow corridor that seemed dark in spite of the windows that lined it. Outside there was a row of newly planted saplings that had not quite taken: their leaves were beginning to turn crinkled and dry, falling on the bare earth. It was hot and musty in the corridor; the windows had not been opened in a while. Margaret hurried after the young man, struggling to keep up. They passed through an office manned by men and women dressed in pale khaki uniforms that gave the impression they were about to leave on an expedition somewhere remote; they did not look at Margaret as she went by, but carried on bending over filing cabinets and typewriters and maps. Half-empty bottles of Fanta stood on desks along with overflowing ashtrays that perfumed the air with the scent of kretek which comforted Margaret. On one wall hung a crude oil painting of a volcano shrouded in cloud, and the national flag had been pinned loosely to a wooden board, where it fluttered at the edges as it caught the weak draught of the ceiling fan." />

Three men in smart grey military uniform sat around a table, laughing gently at something that had just been said; they looked up when Margaret entered. One of them had many medals pinned to his lapel. He said, ‘Who’s this?’
	Margaret recognised the President immediately. He had not aged well; his face was jowly, despite the lips set tightly in permanent defiance of the world. His cheeks seemed even more pockmarked than before, and he looked much heavier. When he spoke, Margaret felt none of the dazzling power of youth he had once had; and the frown on his brow made him seem confused, not angry.
	‘It’s, uh, this is the American visitor I mentioned earlier,’ said the aide-de-camp.
	‘I told you, I’m not in any mood to receive visitors,’ the President replied, lifting a fine china cup slowly to his mouth. His lips reached for the rim of the cup as if uncertain of where it was, and he sipped hesitantly, noisily; he did not look at Margaret.
	‘I promise I will only be a few minutes, Abang Karno.’ She spoke in Javanese, as clearly and calmly as she could, and when she heard her own voice she felt as if the voice belonged not to her but to another person, someone she had long forgotten. ‘It is an honour to meet you again.’
	All three men at the table were studying her now. The President looked her firmly in the eye and his mouth began to draw into a faint smile. ‘Age is a terrible thing, for it destroys the memory. I have always had an excellent memory, but I cannot place you. I find this extraordinary.’ His voice was still clear and strong, perhaps a touch deeper than before; but it did not excite Margaret as it once had.
	‘You have many things to think about, many people to remember. I wouldn’t want you to waste time on just one person like me.’
	‘Every person is worth remembering.’
	‘I have brought something for you,’ said Margaret, pointing at the envelope which the aide-de-camp was still holding. ‘It is something my, um, people would like to present to you as a gesture of goodwill and friendship.’
	‘And who are your people? You speak as if you come from the foothills of Merapi, but clearly you do not mean the central Javanese.’ The men at the table laughed, and Margaret allowed herself a smile.
	‘Sadly not. I mean the good honest people of America. Not so long ago you said that if America gave you a billion dollars and Russia offered you a loaf of bread, you would take the loaf of bread, because it would be given with love. Many of us understood why you said that. But we were hurt, too, because there are those of us who love this country very much.’
	The President smiled broadly and Margaret felt a chill of excitement. ‘But this country is your enemy. I am your enemy, I am dangerous to your country. Isn’t that true?’
	‘I don’t know. That is something for politicians to decide, not ordinary people like me. But even if it is true, are we not meant to love our enemies?’
	‘This woman speaks like an Indonesian, not a Westerner,’ the President said, turning to his companions. ‘Does she not?’ They nodded, and smiled. He said, ‘I think I do remember you now.’ He took the envelope and shook it gently so that its contents fell onto the table. His fingers reached for the first slide with a certainty that suggested he already knew what it was. He held it level with his eyes for a second or two and lowered it without comment. ‘I see,’ he said, sliding it neatly into the envelope. ‘A gift of something that is ours. Tell me, how does one make a gift of something that already belongs to the other person?’
	‘One can’t do that. It is impossible.’
	His smile was charming, yet severe. ‘So there is no gift.’
	‘The gift is not of the painting, of the object itself. It is the restoration of ownership, the reversing of an injustice. Some might say that this is not a gift, that it is simply the course of natural justice, but you and I know that in today’s world it takes courage and no small measure of generosity to provide the gift of fairness.’
	The President looked at his colleagues and at the aide-de-camp. He nodded. ‘What are we to make of this?’ They smiled nervously, unsure of the required response.
	‘I take it you have seen the Capture of Prince Diponegoro’, Margaret continued. ‘Please have a look at the other one. It is something chosen for you.’
	Holding Margaret’s gaze, the President felt for the slide that remained on the table; even when he had brought it to eye-level he continued looking at Margaret, not the slide. She felt a quickening of her pulse, a heavy tapping in her chest and a tingle in her temple; she smiled. His eyes moved slowly to the dark square framed between thumb and forefinger, staring at it with no discernible change in expression. Without moving, he raised his eyes to look at Margaret for a split second before returning to the slide. He remained motionless, unblinking." />

It was a skill he was reputed to have honed as a teenager in Surabaya, where he would sneak into the projection room at the picture house and watch the films from behind the screen, hidden from the good seats occupied by Dutch people. Margaret had never known if this was a true story or one of the thousands of myths about him. In this country you had to surrender to myths, to the uncertainty of stories, to the failure of logic – that was something she had learnt as a child, and she had rediscovered the aptitude quite easily on her return to Jakarta in adulthood. In this case she thought the story was probably true. She liked the idea of a young Sukarno sitting behind the picture screen, for it must have reminded him of the shadow plays so beloved of the Javanese, and given him the impression of being in control. He was not the poor-but-smart young boy the myth made him out to be, but someone already quite powerful. He could see the foreigners and understand what they were watching, but they could not see him. And although those eyes were older and smaller now in the gathering fleshiness of his face, Margaret could still see the intensity of the teenager’s gaze." />

	‘This,’ he began softly, still staring at the slide, ‘I do not think I have seen this before.’ He cleared his throat again. ‘I cannot remember.’ He blinked at the slide – once, twice. A thin frown crept over his brow and his eyes appeared glassy, as if suddenly troubled by a speck of dust.
	Margaret wanted to fill the silence but she could not find the right words, neither in Indonesian nor in English. She looked again at the photograph of the two presidents.

We might even have loved each other. For a time, maybe we even thought we did. We gave each other many gifts. We were both much younger then, and much more foolish. And now, I am afraid that time has passed.’
	‘Perhaps,’ Margaret began; she breathed deeply, trying to sound calm, ‘perhaps it was not foolishness but hopefulness.’
	The President looked at her, his expression changing minutely, becoming less benign, Margaret thought, the edge of his mouth lifting as if to mock her. But when he spoke his voice was very calm. ‘Hope. Americans always talk of hope. What you hope for now is that I will do something for you,’ he said at last. ‘Is this correct?’
	Margaret did not answer.
	‘When Western people offer gifts they expect something in return. When Asian people receive gifts, on the other hand, they think immediately of how to return this kindness. So in fact, the two work very well – though not always fairly. This is why I cannot accept your gift, for I have nothing to give your country in return. Now I must get back to my work as leader of this country.

	‘Please,’ Margaret said, turning back towards the President, ‘you do not want to give anything to my country, I understand that. But would you give me something – the gift of kindness? I have nothing to offer you, I can only ask – plead – for your help.’
	The President raised his eyebrows.
	‘I am asking for your help, as one humble human being to another.’
	He nodded. ‘Go on.’
	‘There is someone I need to find. He is lost in this city. Maybe he is with the army, maybe not. No one seems to know. He is Dutch by birth but Indonesian by nationality, and now I am afraid he has been taken away.’
	‘Ah, een Nederlander’, the President said, laughing his slow rich laugh. He had taken a cigarette from a silver box sitting on the table. ‘I understand from your voice that this is someone you love.’
	Margaret felt light-headed and very hot. She nodded. ‘Some might say that.’

This period had not lasted very long – a year, perhaps – but it seemed to fill the entire canvas of Margaret’s adolescence so that whenever she thought of her childhood now, all she could remember was that there had been so much to give and receive. Maybe this was what happened as one became older: the tiny incidents of youth acquired a magnitude they did not really possess. ‘Never, ever trust your memory,’ her mother used to tell her, ‘it never gives you what you want. When you go back to it, hoping for solace, all you get is misery. And when you need to use it as a library, purely for information, it’s always blank. Just leave it all behind and concentrate on the present.’
	This was what Margaret tried to tell herself over the years, whenever her forays into her memory provided her with nothing but an emptiness in her chest, as if her heart had stopped beating for about five or six seconds. But the problem was that she knew her memories were all true, every last detail. She remembered how this period of gifts and gift-giving had ended, the very moment her life passed from the clarity of childhood into the murky depths of adulthood.

	‘Not too bad. Some days it’s worse than others. Today it seems to be all right. The doctor tells me I’m always going to have a funny walk. But I think he’s wrong.’ He laughed; a clear bright laugh which made Margaret feel better.
	‘What happened, exactly? I’ve only heard sketchy details.’
	Karl sighed and bowed his head, nodding weakly. ‘It’s terrible. I can’t understand how we can do such things to other people.’ He paused for a moment, looking at his leg." />

We had just sat down at the table when we heard the police arrive. They simply marched into the house and took him away. There was nothing I could do. I spoke to them in Dutch, I shouted at them. It was barbaric and unjustified, I said, “You have no authority to arrest him, I will attest to his good character.” And that policeman – that brutish Friesian who’s just arrived from Jakarta to lead this witch-hunt – do you know what he said to me? He said that if I continued to defend a German national he would assume I was a Nazi sympathiser and a traitor. But that wasn’t the worst of it.’ He did not raise his voice but Margaret saw his fine hands curl into fists. ‘There were two other Dutch people there, Jos Smit and Rudi Kunst. They remained silent all the time, they never once tried to intervene. Rudi looked down at his food and Jos coughed and looked out the window, and when the police had taken Walter away he started humming along to the music on the gramophone, as if the party was still going on. I stood up and said, “We have to do something. Walter is our friend. Nationality isn’t important, he’s one of us here in Bali. This is our home. We have to defend ourselves.” And these people, these people I’ve called friends, all they could say was that I shouldn’t antagonise the police, that we have to remember that we are Dutch, and there was nothing we could do for Walter any more. We were in his house, eating his food, and that was all they could say. The host was no longer there, but they wanted the party to continue. I don’t know what came over me. I can’t remember very clearly what happened, but next thing I know I was clinging to the policeman’s back like a barnacle on a huge turtle.’ He laughed again, but this time it did not make Margaret feel better. ‘He shook me off and then all I could see was this hulk standing over me, and when he kicked my leg it was as if he wasn’t even making an effort to hurt me. It was just this gesture to say, You’re nothing to me. At first I thought nothing was wrong, I didn’t feel any pain at all. But when I tried to get up I found my foot was completely useless. I felt so weak and helpless, Margaret. And Jos turned to me and said, “Here, have some cognac.” It was unbelievable. He behaved as if nothing had happened. At that moment I hated him.’ He sighed. ‘I hate this pretence’" />

	‘But that’s just it,’ Karl said, turning to face her once more. He took both her hands and grasped them firmly between his. ‘It’s all a charade. They don’t belong here. They’re merely trying to run away. I know this because that’s what I was trying to do when I came here – running away from a country I didn’t like, from responsibilities, from family, from everything that was mine. But when something like this happens, you realise that you can’t flee. You have a duty to confront the things that frighten you. You can’t just stand by and watch.’
	‘But what can you do?’ She felt his hands tighten around hers; they felt warm and comforting, and she tried to savour the feeling of his skin against hers. She wanted to capture the sensation so that in years to come she would be able to summon it whenever she wanted, in times when she needed comforting or reassurance; for she knew that she might never feel those hands on her again.

It was when I knew I had to leave. My family are still in Holland. Who knows what might happen to them? Hang on, I need to move my leg, it’s getting a bit stiff.’
	He led her across the yard towards the studio. There were no more canvases or pots of paint, and Margaret could only make out the silhouettes of a few easels framing the view of the valley at night. They sat on the steps at the back of the house, where the land fell away steeply. It was very late; the moon bathed the valley in a white light, and at that precise moment it was hard to believe that even daylight was capable of such brilliance.
	‘Look at this,’ Karl said softly. ‘I don’t think I can bear to leave this place, but I have to.’ A night bird started to sing, a two-note call that repeated without the slightest variation.
	‘Why?’ said Margaret, calmly. ‘If you want to, that’s one thing, but I don’t understand why you have to.’ She was lying, she thought, or at best half-lying, because she could understand. Yet a germ of a thought had lodged somewhere in her head, and this invisible, unreasonable grain said: Don’t go, I don’t understand why you are leaving without me.
	‘Staying here makes me feel helpless. I can’t remain in this paradise while such things are happening in Europe. Everyone on this island pretends that the war has nothing to do with them, but it does. We can’t hide here forever. Look at poor Walter.’ The night bird was still singing; the noise it made seemed too sharp and loud for the perfect stillness of the evening.
	‘We’re probably going to leave too,’ Margaret said. ‘Not immediately, maybe in a few months. My parents are finishing up their work anyway, so it’s time to move on. Nothing ever lasts very long in my life. But this time I think we might at least be moving somewhere with running water and electricity.’
	‘Where will you go?’
	She shrugged. ‘I’m not sure. I heard whisperings about America. You?’
	‘Holland. Then, who knows – probably Paris. I liked Paris. But who knows if it will ever be the same again. Things change so quickly, and once they’ve changed they never change back. It’s not true that people leave things or places behind – it’s the things and places that leave us behind.’
	The bird that was singing seemed to have changed its tune; it sounded now like an owl, calling in single ghostly bursts.
	‘That’s silly,’ said Margaret, ‘I don’t agree. Look at you. Bali is staying put, it’s you who is leaving. You have a choice, Bali doesn’t.’
	‘But it is changing, Margaret – you can see that, can’t you? And some day soon it will change so much that you’ll find yourself marooned in a place you no longer know.’
	‘Not if you change with it.’
	‘The place I knew a year ago would not have allowed Walter to be taken away so easily.’
	‘Maybe you didn’t know this place as well as you thought.’
	Across the valley, just below the shoulder of the broad hill, Margaret could see a row of lights – a string of pearly globes that glowed like white fireflies. The lights bobbed up and down slightly, as if they were lamps carried on the end of sticks; but the slope of the hill was very steep and Margaret had never noticed any paths there. There was a tightening in her chest and she began to feel a little pale and light-headed, as if she was about to faint." />

No matter how hard she coughed to try and clear this congestion it would not go away, and she would have to stay awake, listening to her parents’ whispered arguments in the other room, waiting for daybreak, which was the only thing that could bring relief. These were the nights when the malevolent spirits roamed the valleys, the people in the village said; there was dark magic in the air, and that was what caused Margaret’s malaise. ‘Nonsense,’ her mother would say, ‘it’s just a touch of asthma.’ But Margaret had never experienced this discomfort in any other place she had lived. Maybe these Balinese demons were responsible after all; they had taken away the vigorous health of her childhood. And on these nights, if she got out of bed and went to the window, she would often see tiny balls of glowing light drifting across the valley." />

It’s about a boy who wants to kiss a girl but he isn’t sure whether to do it – I read it when I was a boy myself. I don’t know why it has come back to me all of a sudden.’
	‘Why doesn’t he just go ahead and do it? It’s not one of those silly poetic things, is it?’
	‘He’s not sure. She offers him her neck and he thinks she loves him. But when he comes close he realises that all she wants is for him to get rid of the ladybird on her neck. She didn’t really love him after all.’
	‘Poor boy. He has my deepest sympathy.’
	‘No, you mustn’t feel sorry for him, because at the end he sees that it is a good thing. The truth may be painful, but it’s better than an illusion. At least that’s what I remember. And I can see now that my love for Bali has been like that. This island – she hasn’t really loved me, has she? The longing is all one way. It’s because of you that I can see this.’
	‘I don’t understand.’
	‘Whenever I’m with you I see the Indies through your eyes, and it’s wonderful. It’s as if you’re truly a part of this place. It belongs to you and you to it. You don’t have to make any effort, yet you understand it completely. You view it all as a whole, not in parts as the rest of us do. You belong here. When I see that, I realise how I don’t.’
	‘No, I don’t. The only thing I really understand is that the colour of your skin is the only thing that matters.’ In the moonlight, her arm almost touching his, she saw that they were almost exactly the same shade of sandy grey.
	‘I wish I were like you,’ Karl said, ‘but I can’t be. I’ll never have that ability. In the past few months I’ve thought about fleeing to some remote outer island where there are no other Europeans. I’d be like some character from one of those novels, you know, about sea-faring Dutchmen who wash up on some shore and father children with a local woman. But I know I wouldn’t belong there either. And this is why I must return to Holland, even though I hate it. I must go and fight.’
	‘Then I’ll come with you,’ said Margaret. ‘I’ll follow you to Europe.’
	‘That’s ridiculous,’ he said in his calm, quiet manner. ‘You’re too young – what would you do? Where would you live?’
	‘With you.’ Margaret tried to imagine the house he had described, a tall, narrow, dark house. ‘Or somewhere else. I’d just be close to you.’
	He sighed. ‘You have the rest of your childhood to live, Margaret, the rest of your life. You know you can’t come. It’s impossible.’
	The bird had changed its tune again, singing sweetly but very loudly, drowning out all other sounds in the night.
	‘Maybe some day we’ll wash up on the same shore,’ said Margaret.
	He laughed. ‘Maybe.’
	She waited for him to say something else, but there was nothing but birdsong. They remained sitting on the steps for some time, looking at the dancing lights across the valley and listening to the solitary bird. Margaret could feel the warmth of his arm – almost, but not quite, against hers, the fine hairs on his forearm tickling her skin; but she could feel him slipping away from her, easing himself out of her life. She felt the constrictions in her chest come back once more and tried to suppress the urge to cough. I am not in love with this man, she said to herself, I am not in love with him. She hoped that she would feel herself fall out of love with him, just as he was falling out of her world, but that sensation would not come to her.
	After what seemed a very long time, Karl put his hand on hers. He said, ‘I shall never forget you, you know.’ The bird was still singing. Margaret wished it would shut up and leave her alone in this moment with Karl, so that she could commit every detail to memory, where it would remain pure and untroubled for the rest of her life. The outline of his jaw in the moonlight. The damp coolness of his skin. The hesitation, maybe even a slight tremble in his voice.

	Adam did not know why he could remember this detail of the orphanage, or how other images had returned to him, gently folding themselves into the spaces of his memory as if reclaiming some rightful, long-forgotten spot. And although there were many other things that remained beyond his reach – for now, at least – he felt calmer. When memories come back to you there is always the expectation that they will make you happy. Adam had always thought that regaining his past would be unequivocally joyous.

He remembered Z kissing his forehead, remembered the cool touch of her lips on his brow when he had woken up in the middle of the night. Shh, don’t worry, nothing’s going to hurt you, she had whispered, you’re all right, it’s just a bad dream. You’re OK, you’re OK. It had taken him a few moments to realise where he was, for when he opened his eyes there had been only darkness, and it was Zubaidah’s voice that helped him to locate himself in this absence of light.
	My brother, he said. I remember.
	Shh. Calm down. What do you remember?
	Things. Not much. But I remember him now. How he walked, the sound of his voice. Johan. He was called Johan.
	Wait; she got up and pulled the curtains apart, throwing the windows open as wide as she could. There was a thin breath of air in the room now, and Adam could hear the distant barking of dogs. That’s better, she said, it was so airless before.
	She eased her head onto the pillow next to his so that her mouth brushed against his chin. And when she kissed him he surprised himself by knowing how to respond, moving his torso slightly to press against hers. Her body had surprised him because it felt so foreign, unlike anything he had ever imagined, but also familiar, like his. Her belly was flat but fleshy, not at all like his own; but her thighs were very lean, and when squeezed them with his fingers, he could feel the long sinews running down to her knee. He had been fully awake for those few minutes during which they had clung to each other tightly, urgently, like sea-swimmers to a raft. When she moved on top of him he could feel every part of his body with a clarity he had never experienced before, as if each muscle was an articulated word, or thought.
	Afterwards, when they lay side by side in the darkness, she asked him about his brother, and he told her the few things he knew. His brother was older and stronger than he; his brother had left the orphanage first, leaving Adam alone. And those moments of aloneness were filled with a blankness that seemed to expand all the time, until he found he was not terrified by it but reassured by its constant presence.
	He told her about the long low shack where everyone slept, about the leaky roof and the rats that ran along the foot of the walls, and the sound of boys crying in their sleep. He was very calm. He wanted to talk, he wanted to tell Zubaidah what he knew." />

Did he look like you? Adam did not answer. The precise features of Johan’s face still eluded him, but he remembered someone who did not look at all like him, someone who was taller and fairer and stronger. An almond-shaped face cast in permanent half-shadow. For the moment, this was the best he could remember.
	Sorry, said Zubaidah, it must be painful to remember these things.
	No, he said. If someone stays with you often it is painful when they go away. But that is all it is. Pain. When someone is there next to you every second of the day and night their sudden absence does not cause pain, it creates a vacuum, an emptiness with which you have to live every day thereafter. So it is not painful; it is worse than pain.
	She put her hand between his legs and left it there, even though he was not hard. She asked if he missed his brother and he said no, he didn’t. It was the truth. You can’t miss something you can’t remember. He tried to feel a longing for Johan, but all that came to him was a calm that was slowly replacing the yawning emptiness that had been there before.
	We can find him, Zubaidah said, we can find him if you want to. Nothing is impossible. But Adam said no, he did not want to. Why? she asked, but he was unable to answer. There is a time for everything, he thought, and the time for finding Johan had passed, or maybe it had never been the right time. Maybe that time would come in the future, or maybe it never would. He was no longer sure if he wanted to find Johan. My father used to say that you can’t control your future, you just have to let fate run its course. I’m not going to find my brother. It wasn’t meant to happen. Why should it? He doesn’t even know I exist.
	Rubbish, Zubaidah said. If you want to do something, if you want to find someone, you can. He could feel her fingers in his pubic hair. He did not argue with her; it was no use.
	So what do you want to do? You can’t stay in Jakarta. He said, I want to find my father. OK, she said in the dark. We will find him. Not long afterwards, as they were talking, he felt himself harden in her hand, and he propped himself up with one arm so that he could kiss her.

He could not tell if this was Z’s bedroom.
	He dressed and made his way slowly downstairs, pausing momentarily at the top of the staircase that curved elegantly in a horseshoe of gold and marble. The floor was cool and smooth underfoot, and in the kitchen he found a box of European pastries – pretty squares and triangles with colourful cream toppings. He was not sure if they were meant for him, but his hunger was greater than his caution, and he ate one, then two, until he had eaten half the box. They were very sweet and tasted of cinnamon. There was a large mustard-coloured refrigerator of the kind only seen in magazines; but when Adam opened it he found it empty, except for a few bottles of beer and the remains of a celebratory cake, the icing hardened into a crust by the cold.
	‘Good morning, sir.’ A man dressed in a bush jacket and pressed trousers came into the kitchen; Adam recognised him as the driver who had brought them back yesterday. ‘Miss Zubaidah has asked me to take you wherever you want to go today.

	They walked along a path that followed the curve of the riverbank and disappeared now and then into long grass. Sometimes the sharp edge of the grass caught their hands, and Johan yelped with pretend-pain. He wanted to make Farah laugh, but she didn’t. He stopped and turned around to take her hand, leading her through the path that had disappeared once more. They walked through a thicket of trees and for a few moments there was no light at all, and when they emerged the path curved sharply and brought them round to an old pontoon.
	Johan. Farah spoke in a whisper. Johan.
	That’s what I wanted to show you.
	Johan. She stepped on to the pontoon with him. My god.
	Before them there hung a huge mass of fluorescent green light, like the beginnings of a raincloud on a hot windy day, billowing slowly, expanding here, contracting there. It stretched out languidly as if pawing at an invisible fly, and then pulled back again, illuminating a stretch of black water and then casting it into darkness once more.
	Fireflies, said Johan. I really wanted you to see them.
	There were clusters of the same glowing light on the trees, shimmering. Johan took Farah’s hand and walked along the path, and all along the riverbank there were clusters of this gold-green light in the trees, even on the very highest branches where they coloured the night sky.
	It’s like Christmas, Farah said. Christmas in some Scandinavian country.
	How would you know? It’s not as if you’ve ever been to Lapland.
	I don’t know, she laughed. I just imagined it this way." />

	You’re not going to come back, are you?
	The mass of fireflies curled slowly towards the water, and Johan wondered what would happen if it touched the river, whether all the lights would suddenly switch off and they would find themselves plunged into darkness, or maybe night would switch suddenly to day.
	And because he did not answer, she said, Are you going to find out what happened to your brother?
	No, he said firmly. He’s gone and I don’t want to know any more.
	Good. Promise me you’ll come back safely. He felt her fingers wiggle in his hand.
	You’re crazy.
	She turned to look at him and there was enough light in the moonless night for him to see that her eyes were clear and wide. Thank you, she said. Thank you for bringing me here.
	He could smell the richness of her breath, a slight saltiness, and her hand began to feel hot and slightly sticky in his.
	He leaned towards her and when he kissed her he found her lips were cooler than he had imagined, and firmer too.

	No, she said at last. He could feel her breath against his neck. It’s wrong, Johan.
	Why?
	You know why. She did not move away from him but let her head rest against his collarbone.
	I’m not your brother, he said.
	Don’t say that, Johan.

There was nowhere for her to go, nothing more she could do. She had done her best with the President, she had given it everything she had, and still she had come up short. She had never experienced this feeling of utter defeat before, and she did not know how she should feel. Angry? Frustrated? Frightened? Humiliated? No, not any of those, and yet all of them at once. She felt helpless – yes, helpless, that was it – but this state of helplessness was not terrifying as she’d always feared it would be. It brought with it something worse than terror (which could, after all, be overcome): an eerie unease, a feeling that the worst was yet to come. When she thought of the future now (the future: what did that even mean?), she could see nothing, feel nothing. She did not know what she would do, either for herself or for Adam or anyone else, today or tomorrow or any time thereafter. There was no vague sense of possibility, of things simply sorting themselves out by a combination of fate and manipulation. There was just a dreadful emptiness waiting to be filled with the unknown.
	She had always thought that even if she learnt of Karl’s passing away, or if she had known, definitively, that he was never to come into her life again, she would experience a certain calm – a relief, or a profound liberation. Finally that niggly grain of hope embedded in her would go away, and she would no longer fall asleep remembering his slim hands and uneven walk. But she did not feel calm now, nor relieved nor liberated. She had lost Karl, she was sure, but she still – irrationally, stupidly – hoped that he was out there. The years ahead of her were filled not with calm, but with a horrible uncertainty. And it was all her fault.
	Her fault.
	She thought about Adam. She looked out of the open windows at the dusty shantytowns, the mass of people on the streets, jostling for space in the city. She hated the idea of Adam wandering alone here, and she hated the idea that she had abandoned him to this fate. That was something she would have to live with for the rest of her life, she thought. But she would manage. There are some things that cause you pain, that lodge themselves in your consciousness the way a splinter or piece of shrapnel might embed itself in your flesh; but the human body had a way of dealing with it that could dull the pain so that you didn’t feel it after a while. Your life would continue as usual, and only you would know of this thing that you carried in your body." />

She would feel as children must feel when they had done something wrong or failed an exam, and the moment of confession arrived, only their parents already knew what had happened. Her own childhood had been free of such moments of anxiety, but she wished it hadn’t. God she wished it hadn’t. She wished that when she was a child she’d known how it felt to fail and to have someone to say, It’s OK, next time it won’t be so bad, you can try again, it doesn’t matter.

Even Bill didn’t have a clue what was going on – for a moment he thought that Sukarno had personally escorted you home! We certainly didn’t expect young Adam to hop out.’
	Margaret squeezed Adam’s hand. She had barely let go of him since stepping into the house. When she first realised he had come back, she’d felt like crying. For the first time since adolescence – maybe even infancy – she’d felt an uncontrollable welling up of tears. She hugged him and put her head on his collarbone, letting her tears wet his shirt. She looked ridiculous, she knew, but she didn’t care. He had been eating when she came back; there were half-eaten packets of nasi padang on the table; fat flies sat motionless like sultanas on the turmeric-stained rice. ‘Don’t ever leave me like that again,’ she scolded, sniffing loudly.
	‘I’m sorry,’ he said. When she looked at him she saw that his eyes were moist and slightly teary too. He lifted his hand to wipe his eyes; there were grains of rice sticking to his fingers. He smiled but she could see that he was preoccupied with something else. His eyes seemed pinched, older now than they’d been a few days ago. He wiped his hands on a dishcloth that was lying on the table; the cloth was printed with the words Good Morning, which skipped up and down as he cleaned his fingers. He reached for her and put his arms around her slowly, embracing her for a few deliberate moments. ‘I’m really glad to be back,’ he said.
	‘Where’s Din?’ Margaret asked, feeling she already knew the answer.
	‘He’s in jail – where he should be.’ Bill told her everything he knew – honestly, he said: there had been a plot to assassinate the President, which Bill and his people had known about, and Bill had thought that if they could prevent it and find evidence against the culprits, he would be able to present it to the President as proof of American goodwill. No, he was not intending to find and fund these terrorists so that they would kill a president who was no longer favourable to the States – god forbid such cynicism. Why would the United States of America want to destabilise this country? It was unstable enough as it was. Call it currying favour or bargaining or whatever you want – the ultimate aim was to help Indonesia in some way or another. Din was one of the ringleaders they had heard about, and Bill had been keen to keep track of him, that’s all. And Adam, well, Adam had come this close – this close – to being implicated in a major conspiracy. Thank god for that girl.
	‘What girl?’
	‘The one we met,’ said Mick, handing Bill another bottle of beer. They moved and talked slowly, as if they had been doing something physically strenuous. It was the relief, thought Margaret; they were exhausted by the relief of finding Adam.
	‘Her name is Zubaidah,’ said Adam. ‘I guess she saved me.’
	‘Turns out she isn’t a red-blooded commie, after all,’ Mick said.
	‘I knew there was something weird about that girl. I just couldn’t figure her out – I didn’t like her. I thought she was duplicitous and insincere,’ said Margaret. ‘But it does at least prove that it takes a woman to work things out.’
	Mick said, ‘Margaret didn’t like being out-Margareted by the young lassie.’
	‘No,’ said Adam. ‘She was not insincere. She helped me see things clearly. Without her, I would have ended up doing things I didn’t want to. This time it was Din, but it could have been anyone. I was just allowing anyone to take advantage of me. But Zubaidah didn’t. She didn’t push me, she just…I don’t know. She helped me, that’s all I’m saying.’
	Margaret watched him as he spoke; he looked down at the table, raising his eyes to meet hers only now and then, as if afraid of challenging her. She put her hand on his forearm. ‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I was just worried about you, that’s all.’
	‘Don’t worry,’ said Adam. ‘It’s not your fault things turned out the way they did.’
	Margaret wanted to believe that this was true, that she was not in some way to blame for the fact that Adam was now truly an orphan, and that Karl was missing forever, most probably dead. She could not shake the feeling that the current state of affairs was due, in some major way, to her shortcomings, her misjudgement, despite Adam’s trusting, almost grateful smile, which made her feel even more guilty. He had trusted her too readily, she thought, too unquestioningly And his utter faith in her had, in turn, made her believe that she was capable of achieving anything." />

We have tried everything, but I think you should know that the signs are not encouraging. I think,’ she paused, wanting to sound firm but supportive, ‘I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that we might not be able to find your father.’
	Adam stared at his still-greasy fingers; he let them hover rigidly over the table, watching them as if entranced by their stillness. ‘He might still come back, somehow. Nothing is impossible. I know you think so too.’
	Margaret nodded. ‘That’s right, I do. I guess some stupid part of my brain will always be wired up to think like that. But we all have to face the facts sometime – even me.’

You would feel one or two heavy raindrops on your arms and the skies would darken, and you would think that the drought was over; but then the clouds would dissolve and the air would lose the smell of moisture, and the aridity would return.

	‘You liked her, didn’t you?’
	‘Yes, I did.’
	There were not many cars on the road this evening, but every so often they would see convoys of army trucks carrying troops, or armoured vehicles posted outside buildings. Evening brought with it a sense of anxiety. Margaret did not think that she had ever associated darkness with fear; no, that was wrong: she had done so when she was a child.
	‘I’m sorry I was negative about her,’ said Margaret. ‘It’s just that my judgement has been so shaken by everything that happened with Din. I couldn’t trust anyone with you.’
	He nodded.
	‘Because Din was not a bad person,’ she continued. ‘I shared an office with him, for god’s sake, I couldn’t have been that wrong about him. Very, very misguided, perhaps, but not fundamentally evil. But from the moment he involved you in whatever he was up to, well, that’s when I stopped having any sympathy for him.’
	‘I think we should wait a while,’ Adam said. ‘Just a while. You never know what might happen. Z might be able to find my father. We just need to get in touch with her. I still have this feeling he’s not far away. There’s still hope, I know.’
	Margaret looked at Adam’s face, so much older now than it had been a few days ago, but still that of a boy.

	Adam looked out of the window. The early evening air was still warm and unsoothing. ‘When I was small I used to dream about going abroad. I used to read stories about children living in Europe and imagine what it was like to live amongst them. My father used to say, Son, you have no idea, it’s better here. I always thought it could not be better here. Now I’m not so sure. I don’t know what it’s like in Europe or America, or even Malaysia, but I don’t want to go.

	Margaret could find no argument to counter this. There was no reason for her to take him away from Indonesia, yet she had no choice.
	The campus was dark and silent, except for the rhythmic banging of a tin door at the far end of the badminton courts. In the distance, at that undefined place where the range of solid university buildings gave way to the flimsy shacks of the semi-slums, they could see a few kerosene lamps, their lonely dim lights revealing a few figures moving in the shadows. There was a Western song playing: ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’, Margaret thought, though she could not be sure. Thin clouds of insects had gathered above the drains, anticipating the showers that would become more frequent from now on; but Margaret would not be in this city for the coming rainy season, she thought, nor, perhaps, for any other.
	They went up the flight of stairs to her office. The barricade of piled-up desks had been removed, leaving nothing but splinters and iron bars on the floor. The door to Margaret’s office was ajar, and when Margaret tried to switch on the light she found that there was no electricity. In the last remnants of the evening light she could discern the clear pale space where Din’s desk had stood on the far side of the room. The piles of paper on her desk had been shifted around, and several sheets had fallen to the floor, where some of her books and files lay scattered haphazardly. The only thing missing seemed to be the blue-and-white jar which contained her pens and pencils. She went round the desk and sat in the chair, reaching down for the lowest drawer. Even in the dark, she had no trouble finding the crevasse which sheltered the key; she unlocked the bottom drawer, her fingers feeling the ample mound of paper that was her thesis. She wondered why she had kept it for so long; at this point, it seemed a ridiculous object, a dead thing, a hindrance. She pushed it aside and felt around for her passport. On the way here, she had, just briefly, wondered what she would do if the passport had gone missing. She had given it so little thought, been so casual in her treatment of it, but now she’d found herself praying that it would be there; thank god, it was.
	It took a while for them to find their way back to the car. Stripped of all light and movement, the campus buildings did not seem to be where they usually were. The Embassy driver was standing by the Buick; they could see the pinprick glow of his cigarette. He had left the engine running, and when he saw them approaching he got into the car and put his hands on the steering wheel. ‘I got a call on the radio. Mr Schneider says don’t come to the Embassy. I am to take you to this address.’ He passed them a piece of paper as the car reversed sharply before moving off again. Margaret could not make out the handwriting. ‘Mr Schneider says, come quick, no time to lose.’" />

He must have been playing truant, for it was in the middle of the day, the sun slicing through the scant canopy of the scrubby seaside forest. And it had to have been a good few years after he’d arrived at Karl’s house, for he’d walked without hesitation or fear, scrambling over the patches of slippery rock that had become familiar to him. He recalls this now, his ease with his surroundings, his feeling of intimacy with the trees and the water and the sand. He had walked for some distance when he saw Karl about twenty yards from the shoreline, sitting on a fallen tree trunk, half-hidden by the shade of some shrubs. He was bent over slightly, concentrating on a book, or a sheet of paper, looking up occasionally to squint at the sea.
	Adam slowed down immediately, trying to tread as lightly as possible, but the crunch of dead leaves and coarse sand underfoot seemed to reverberate every time he put a foot down. He considered turning back and running away – the risk of being discovered was too great. But there was something in Karl’s actions, the intensity with which he looked at those papers, that made Adam curious. He skirted round in a wide arc, moving further inland so that Karl would not see him, but the noise he made as he pushed his way slowly through the undergrowth was considerable: Karl must have heard. And yet Karl did not once look inland, in the direction of the rustling foliage, focusing instead on the sheet of paper in his lap. From a slightly elevated position, Adam saw that Karl was drawing, his hand moving fluently across the page, sometimes in long smooth strokes, other times in tiny precise flicks. He had never seen Karl do this before, and was amazed at the delicacy of his father’s hands, which he had only ever seen wielding a machete or an axe or a broom. He could not, from where he was hiding, make out the shapes in the drawing, and so he began to inch closer, until he was certain that Karl would turn around and confront him." />

At last he could see, over Karl’s shoulder, a low ridge of pencilled hills, a house perched precariously on a slope. He came closer still. There was one person in the drawing, a young person, though Adam could not quite make out if it was a boy or a girl. Its features were exaggerated, but clearly Western. It was a girl, Adam decided.
	‘Who’s that, pak?’ Adam said. It no longer mattered to him that he would be found out.
	When Karl turned it was clear that he’d had no idea of Adam’s presence. He frowned and blushed and smiled, all at once. ‘I thought you were at school,’ he said. There was a look on his face that Adam recognised because it was something he was all too familiar with: shame.
	‘Who’s that?’ Adam said, pointing at the sheet of paper.
	Karl looked at the drawing for a few moments, and then he laughed loudly, folding it in half with one neat movement. ‘Oh, that’s nothing, I was just, um, bored…playing around. Look – see what your father can do with this simple sheet of paper!’ And with a few deft folds he turned the drawing into a paper boat. ‘Come on!’ he said, and ran down to the beach. He waded into the shallows, his thin trousers getting wet up to the knee. He set the boat gently on the calm afternoon waves. The little vessel rocked back and forth for a few seconds before being overcome by the swell.
	As he walked home with Karl, Adam did not think about the drawing, or about Karl’s embarrassment at having been discovered. He was merely thankful to have avoided a reprimand for having skipped school." />

A motorbike lying by the side of the road, its wheels twisted and crushed. He had seen this place before, and he knew they were going to Zubaidah’s house.
	They drove through ornate wrought-iron gates painted with touches of gold paint; they drew up alongside a sports car that Adam did not recognise. The house seemed even bigger than he remembered. The front doors were made of heavy dark timber, their veneer reflecting the light cast by the car’s headlamps.
	‘Margaret, thank god you made it,’ Bill said, running to meet her. He reached out to her and held her elbow as if to reassure himself that she was really there. ‘There was a demonstration outside the Embassy that’s carried on into the night. Those guys were lighting fires – it was getting very tense out there, so I thought you should come here. It isn’t safe around the Embassy. The paperwork’s done. You can be in Singapore by lunchtime tomorrow.’
	‘This is Zubaidah’s place, isn’t it?’
	‘Her father’s, yes. How’s the boy doing?’
	‘OK, I think.’
	‘We got him, Margaret,’ Bill said, his voice dropping almost to a whisper. ‘ We got him.’
	Margaret felt a sudden tensing in her chest, a rush of blood to her temples.
	‘Well, actually the girl found him,’ said Bill, taking Adam’s bag into the house. ‘Come on, we need to hurry.’
	Adam ran up the steps ahead of Margaret and Bill. He rushed into the hallway and paused briefly at the foot of the great sweeping staircase. Z emerged from her bedroom; she was wearing pyjamas and her hair was down. She looked more childlike than Adam remembered. He started towards her but she was pointing at a spot behind him. He stopped and turned around. At the threshold of a door off the hallway, Karl was standing looking up at Adam. He held on to both sides of the door frame, supporting himself as he tried to raise a smile. He coughed – a heavy dry spasm.
	Margaret said, ‘Good god.’
	‘Bapak,’ Adam cried. But his voice seemed to choke even as he called out to Karl and he could say no more. He ran down the stairs and eased Karl’s arm over his shoulder so that he could support him. He helped him back into the room and laid him down on the sofa. He had never realised how small and light his father was; perhaps they were both small and light in this enormous house in this enormous city. Adam covered Karl with a blanket that Z had given him.
	‘Margaret,’ Bill whispered, ‘I know he’s ill and weak, but if you want to get out of this place I’d advise you to do it now. I’ve got papers for him too. All of you.’
	‘Out of the question, Bill. Look at him.’

It was as though she had been doing it her whole life.
	Adam stayed with Karl, holding his hand until he drifted to sleep. Margaret and Bill left the room, and Adam could hear them arguing outside. They were trying to keep their voices down, and although Adam could not quite hear what they were saying he understood the thrust of their conversation. It did not matter to him now whether he left this country or not. All that mattered was that he was not separated from his father.
	‘Quite against my principles,’ explained Z later, ‘I went to see my dad. Adam told me about the search for his foster father and it’s no secret that my dad has – oh, I hate saying this word – connections. I don’t even like thinking about it; it makes me ashamed. But I had no choice. It’s the only way to get things done quickly. In this country you could say it’s the only way to get things done.’
	‘Yes,’ said Bill, ‘I know about your father. He’s very friendly with the President.’
	‘I don’t know how far their friendship extends, but they help each other out in one way or another – mostly financially. They were schoolmates in Surabaya, you see. So he put in a call to the President – a personal instruction from the President carries much weight, as you can imagine. They found Mr de Willigen at once. It seems he had been marked for repatriation – mistakenly, they claim – but then he fell ill and had to be moved from one hospital to another. Police bureaucracy isn’t very efficient.’
	‘It was a very brave and generous thing for you to do,’ said Margaret, ‘and I hope your father didn’t mind too much.’
	Z shrugged. ‘He didn’t seem too concerned. He was quite preoccupied with something else – a painting, I think, something the President has asked him to finance. My dad was being quite grumpy about it, says he’s been paying for too many of the President’s personal luxuries recently. I think the President is getting more and more extravagant. Apparently this painting is huge and has lions and tigers in it, and Dad can’t really afford it, but what can he do? He still needs the President to help him with his business – or whatever they do together. I never ask too many questions; I don’t want to know about all that sordid business.’
	Margaret smiled. ‘I bet it’s some painting,’ she said. ‘Thank you nonetheless. I know it must have been difficult for you.’
	Z paused a while, gazing absently at the ceiling. She smiled weakly. ‘It’s funny. I always swore I would never ask for his help, that I would be independent and do whatever I pleased. But now that I’ve done it, well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It feels quite, I don’t know, normal. I guess I’ll just have to live with it.’
	‘Terrible, isn’t it, how that happens,’ Margaret laughed. ‘The way things suddenly become acceptable.’
	Z nibbled at her fingernails, frowning. ‘Problem is, it feels more than acceptable, it feels almost nice.’ She looked at Adam and put her free hand out to him. He clasped it with both hands but did not say anything." />

	Johan was some way ahead and Adam struggled to keep up, for Johan was stronger and taller than he was. They were a long way from the orphanage now, in the low rocky hills that lay between the orphanage and the sea, sheltered by trees that would never grow very tall because of the brine and the poor sandy soil. In the dark Adam could not see Johan’s face clearly, not even when he finally caught up with him.
	‘Go back, Adam, you shouldn’t have followed me.’
	‘But what are you doing? We aren’t allowed here. We should be asleep.’
	‘I know. That’s why you should have stayed in bed.’
	‘I couldn’t sleep. I’m excited. About tomorrow.’
	Johan did not reply. All Adam could hear was the sea breeze that had picked up a little; it carried the sound of the water beyond, and suddenly the sea seemed close by, attainable. Johan sighed. ‘Idiot,’ he said, but he did not sound angry. ‘Come on, it’s not far.’
	They stumbled over rough ground, their ankles scraping against rocks. Ahead of them they could hear the foamy rush of the retreating tide, the froth and pull of the waves on the shore; and underfoot they could feel the thorny grass giving way to sandier ground. But still the sea remained out of sight, beyond a screen of scrubby bushes and a thick barrier of rocks. There was light in the night sky, enough to make out the thin tidal rivulets that snaked towards the sea; but when Adam and Johan looked up at the sky they saw it was shrouded in cloud and they could not tell where the moon was. They reached the foot of a mound of sharp volcanic rock that was silvery with brine. Johan went first, picking his way nimbly amidst boulders that were powdery to the touch. Sometimes loose shards fell away beneath his feet, but he was quick and sure and did not slow down. From time to time he would stop and wait for Adam, reaching out to guide him and make sure he did not fall. He did not like it when Adam fell. But the sea was close by now, and Johan and Adam could smell the freshness of the breeze and the rumble of the waves that grew louder as they scrambled up the slope; even when they slipped they did not feel the sharpness of the rocks underfoot.
	‘There, Adam,’ Johan said when they reached the top of the rocks. ‘There it is.’
	Adam sat on the low flat boulder beside him. He was out of breath from the climb, and his eyes took time to adjust to what lay before him: an immensity of darkness, flecked now and then with glimmers of light on the crests of waves. He had not expected the colour of the sea, either, an inky blackness that matched the colour of the night sky. He could not make out the horizon.
	Johan put his arm around Adam’s shoulders. ‘We’ve done it. We always said we would see the sea one day. Together.’
	Adam nodded. He pulled at Johan’s arm and Johan felt how small his hand was. ‘On the other side of the sea,’ Adam whispered, ‘is that our new home?’
	Johan did not answer.
	‘Our new home is far away, I guess,’ said Adam, ‘all the way over there.’
	‘Yes,’ said Johan at last. ‘Somewhere over there.’
	‘Really?’ Johan felt the tug of Adam’s hand again, his quick shallow breaths that always came when he was excited, or scared. ‘We won’t be able to see the orphanage from over there, will we?’
	‘I don’t suppose so. The sea is very wide.’
	‘I don’t think I like it. The sea, I mean. It frightens me.’
	Johan continued to stare into the distance. ‘It’s time to go now, Adam. You have to go to sleep and be up early tomorrow. Be a good boy. It’s a big day for you.’
	‘OK.’
	‘You can find your way home. Don’t look back, just keep going until you’re at the orphanage, OK? I’ll be along soon, don’t worry.’
	‘Why don’t you come back too?’
	‘I just want to stay here for a while, look at the sea. I like it. Anyway, I’m older than you, remember?’ He laughed and Adam felt better. ‘Go home and sleep. I’ll be back soon.’
	Adam got up and began to pick his way between the rocks. He did not like being on his own, but he had always done what Johan told him to do, and Johan had never been wrong. He began to think that maybe he was silly to have been frightened by the sea. Johan was not frightened by the sea; Johan was not frightened of anything. Adam paused at the foot of the rocks. He had been silly to tell Johan that he was afraid of the sea; perhaps he would go back and sit with Johan and show that he was not so afraid after all. He would climb the rocks again, and they would sit together for a while, and then they would walk back to the orphanage and in the morning they would travel to their new home; there was nothing to be afraid of.
	Johan was not there when Adam traced his way back to where they had been sitting. He looked down along the line of boulders, but there was no movement. Out to sea: halfway along the wide flat beach Johan was walking slowly towards the dark water, to the area where the sand was not light-coloured but grey and wet from the outgoing tide. The shallows were scattered with rocks that protruded from the water like sea creatures emerging from the depths. Adam did not want to venture into the water; he was seized by the urge to call out to Johan. Don’t go there, Johan, don’t go there, he wanted to shout. But Johan was already too far away, and the wind had picked up again and Adam knew Johan would not hear him.
	Adam ran towards the sea. Suddenly he knew that Johan should not go into the water. ‘Johan’, he cried. He ran across the sand; tiny sharp things pricked his feet but he did not stop running. It was difficult to run in the thick sand: he slipped and fell. It did not hurt when he fell. At some point it turned damp and muddy and sticky underfoot and there were rocks everywhere. Still he did not stop running. Johan was far away now, wading in the shallows, the water up to his calves. Adam slipped on a rock. He felt it slice through the side of his foot like a sharp thin blade but it did not hurt. The sand turned to mud, and he could not run quickly. Johan. He looked ahead but Johan did not turn round. The mud was cold and there were things in it, cold hard things that Adam could feel on his feet and he did not like them. Shells, maybe they were shells. He felt water between his toes, then up to his ankles. The water was warm and made the mud feel less cold and Johan was standing still now, looking out at the emptiness of the sea before him. The water came up to his knees but sometimes it would swell and rise to his waist before falling away again. Adam waded deeper into the water. He could see Johan’s back, the white shirt streaked with dirt. The people at the orphanage had made them put on shirts that morning, him and Adam, because they were to be presented to those nice foreigners who were going to take them away. The shirts had been fresh and clean, but now they were dirty.
	‘Don’t go there,’ Adam cried as loudly as he could. ‘Don’t leave me, Johan.’
	Johan turned round slowly. It was dark and Adam could not see his face properly. The waves washed around his knees and made him feel unsteady.
	‘Go back, Adam. I told you, you shouldn’t have followed me.’ He spoke calmly, but Adam knew he was not calm. Adam waded towards him; the sharp pebbles and the mud did not bother him any more.
	‘Adam, don’t.’
	‘But why? What are you doing?’
	Johan turned away from him, looking out at sea as if searching for some invisible object. Adam could feel the water rising to his ribcage.
	‘Johan, what’s wrong? Come back. I can’t see your face. I can’t see your face.’ And it was this faceless Johan that terrified Adam more than the sea and the dangerous things that lurked in the mud.
	Johan did not move. ‘Don’t look at me, Adam. Go back. Please.’
	Adam did not want to cry, he did not want to upset Johan even more, but his eyes were already cloudy with tears. He stopped trying to reach Johan. He would never be able to get to him. He knew that now. His brother wanted to go away from him, and there was nothing he could do. He said, ‘You said you would never leave me, Johan.’ The waves washed gently around his waist and made his shirt damp and cold. He rubbed his eyes and they smarted from the saltwater on his hands. He was right to have been afraid of the sea. He did not want to be here. He wanted to forget this place, this time, forever. This world, he thought, was not a good place, for in this world you could find yourself alone in an instant. You turned away and all was lost, washed out to sea. He wished he were in some other world, some place other than this.
	‘Don’t cry, you idiot,’ Johan said. He was next to Adam now; he smacked Adam on the back of the head and pulled his ear. ‘Silly boy,’ he said, ‘I only wanted to go for a swim, see what it’s like. I’ve never been swimming. You don’t like the sea. That’s why I said you shouldn’t have come.’
	‘I was frightened. The sea. I was afraid.’
	Adam could not stop crying. It was stupid, but he could not stop: Johan was with him now, and everything would be all right. Everything would be all right.
	‘You idiot,’ Johan said, putting his arm around Adam. ‘Just forget about it. Just pretend it didn’t happen.’
	They reached the shore where the sand was dry and not muddy. They climbed the rocks again and found that it was not so difficult this time. They walked home in the murky darkness, and when they reached the orphanage they found it just as it had been. They took off their wet clothes and slept in Johan’s bed. Adam felt safe again; he felt the unchanging warmth of Johan’s body and he was no longer afraid. Tomorrow their lives would change, but he was not afraid.
	Johan said, ‘Go to sleep now, Adam. Forget it all. You’re a good boy. Don’t worry, I won’t leave you. Go to sleep.’" />

It is surprisingly smooth, especially given the terrain through which it runs: it cuts determinedly across the mosquito-filled marshland on the coastline of the Java Sea and does not flinch when it begins its ascent into the hills around Sumedang. It is all the more remarkable when you consider that it was built in less than a year, in 1808. What is less surprising is that thousands died in its construction – of malaria, sunstroke, famine and simple exhaustion. Even with modern cars it is a long journey. The road is sun-baked and the air that comes in through the open windows is warm and dry, and does little to alleviate the discomfort of the traveller. There is plenty of time to think about the things that may have taken place on this route in days past; all the things that may have happened in your life.
	The road ends in the far east of Java. Further along there are ferry ports to the islands, like Ketapang, just a short hop away from Bali, and then on to the outlying islands that few ever visit. In these ports that lead to nowhere it sometimes feels as though you are at the very edge of the world, at the end of all things familiar. Small boats sail towards a barren horizon, towards emptiness, it seems. The places that lie beyond will, you think, always remain invisible." />

	‘Yes.’
	‘I hated keeping the truth from you. I hated lying. But you were happy. Weren’t you?’

	Karl sighed. ‘I was going to take you on holiday to Malaysia for your sixteenth birthday. I imagined everything: we would go for a nice dinner and I would tell you everything when we got there and leave you to make the decision. But then all this happened.’
	They both managed to laugh.
